**1992-93 SPRIG FARM DIARY**

by Bob Granucci, a member since 1981

Prologue: Dean and Bill had been working hard at Sprig Farm during the off-season. On October 17th, when we brought up my motor, bedding, etc. and also the club wine,[^1] Muriel and I saw how much they had accomplished The duck cleaning facilities were renovated, the roof sported a new weather vane, designed and assembled by Fred Ellers, and a new well was being dug. There were even bigger changes were in the field. Ponds \#2 and \#14 were transformed from broad sheets of water into series of potholes. Blind \#2 was so well concealed that I passed it by when we took a boat ride. We saw only a few ducks on the club property. However, Fred Ellers, who arrived earlier, had seen over 2000 birds get off our ponds.

[^1]: This season's club wines consist of nonvintage Auguste Rampon Chardonnay, Hacienda Chardonnay, '89, Fratelli Barale Barbera de Alba '89 and '89 Desmoulins Chateauneuf-du-Pape, all from Trader Joe's.

Saturday, October 24th: Off and running.

Friday afternoon's warm (80 plus degrees), hazy and windless weather would have been fine for dove shooting, but it couldn't have portended worse for ducks. Daisy and I walked along the east side and saw a few ducks on the state property, a small fraction of the numbers seen there in previous years on the eve of opening day. However, many ducks were congregated on the dirt mounds along the far side of \#10 pond. The mosquitoes chased us back to the club house. More warm weather was forecast for Saturday and although I was delighted to be back at the club, I wasn't really looking forward to the shoot.

Friday's dinner lifted my spirits (barbecued steak complemented by fresh prawns courtesy of Al White and Bill Richardson, salmon mousse and apple strudel courtesy of Harri Monteith). I drew fourth choice and, with \#8 and \#7 already taken, selected \#1, because of its big island and because I had shot there on opening day last season.

The night was so warm that at 5:00 a.m., when I got up and took Daisy outside, I didn't need a jacket. We were all surprised to see a fire burning in the west. I originally thought it was a grass fire in the hills beyond \#680 but Bob Voydat, who arrived at breakfast time, said he had seen a fire engine going through the gate to Rich Island.

At shooting time, I was in the blind and at the ready. The sky was clear and the air still. On opening day it's always thrilling to hear the firing start all over the marsh. During the first few minutes, only a few coots flew overhead. Later on, there were many ducks in the air, but nothing came in range. I should have remembered that scenic as it is, \#1 is simply not a fair weather pond. At 8:00 o'clock I fired at a spoonie over my head; it came down at the west end of the pond and dove. Daisy went out, stayed with it and made a strong retrieve. Meanwhile the weather freshened. A canopy of high clouds obscured the sun and a cool breeze came up from the northeast. It was pleasant being out on the marsh again and watching the ducks flying around, even though my only shooting opportunities were a teal and another spoonie (both missed).

Around 10:00 o'clock I was looking at the horizon when I raised my eyes and was surprised by a wing-set mallard 30 yards overhead. I mounted the gun correctly and brought it down with one shot. Daisy made a routine retrieve. After this the action was extremely slow and I went in at 11 o'clock.

Most others did far better. The east side has apparently revived. Bill Armstrong (\#10) and Clay Judd and Doug Alberger (\#12) had limits by 8:15. Dean had a good shoot at \#5A. Blinds \#7 (Mike Monteith) and \#8 (Tom Lucas) also shot well, as did \#3. Sadly, Fred Ellers downed but lost a goose at \#14.

Bag: 1 mallard and 1 spoonie.

Other: Daisy's blind manners were exemplary. She stayed down and quiet all morning (that's the advantage of a big island) and she ignored the decoys.

An owl has taken up residence at the club; it hooted all night on Friday.

The game warden visited blinds \#5A, \#6, \#7 and \#8.

At noon, even with the field glasses, I couldn't see any indication of the fire.

\-----

Wednesday, October 28th: Ideal weather -- few birds.

I stopped at the ranger station on Tuesday afternoon and learned that Saturday's fire burned two buildings at Pelican Point; one man had been injured. The weather was mild, partly cloudy with a 15-20 mph westerly wind, far more pleasant than the previous Friday. Daisy and I stayed out about an hour and a half, retrieving dummies and walking along the west side road. I saw many ducks, mostly widgeon, in the shore area between \#7 and \#8, but very few anywhere else. The wind kept the mosquitoes from being a problem.

On Wednesday morning I went to \#8. The sky was grey and overcast and the west wind was even stronger than Tuesday afternoon. Conditions were ideal, the only problem was that there were very few ducks. Shortly after shooting time, a pair of mallards landed in the line of decoys I had set out in the pond 35 yards parallel to the island. When they flared I brought down the hen with my first shot but missed a shot at the drake. Daisy started chasing the untouched drake. I had to wade out into pond and call her to fetch the hen. As soon as she saw it in the water she went after it and brought it in. Around 8:00 o'clock I called in a teal and brought it down with one shot, another routine retrieve for Daisy. After 9:00 o'clock the ducks stopped flying so at quarter to ten I picked up my decoys and took a ride out to \#5 before coming in. Clay Judd and Jim Jacobsen got 6 mallards at \#2. Everyone else had mediocre results. Fred Ellers was skunked at \#5.

Bag: 1 mallard and 1 teal.

Other: Alan "I'm a rat man" White trapped 5 mice in his room.

Joe served an excellent dinner: baked pork chops, mashed potatoes and gravy; Wednesday's lunch, Hungarian goulash and tuna salad sandwiches, was also quite good.

According to Bill, there are two owls living at the club.

Jim Graziani, a friend from our days on the USF rifle team and now a neighbor at Germain, told me they had an excellent opening weekend.

\-----

Saturday, October 31st: A pleasant, slow morning.

On Thursday, the season's first storm brought 0.90 inches of rain to the city and over 4 inches in Marin County. On Friday afternoon there was a good breeze from the west and the marsh had a fresh, pleasant atmosphere. I greatly enjoyed the scenery on my walk along the east side; the very few ducks I saw seemed to be flying west into the marsh from the Delta.

I took Blind \#8 on Saturday morning and was ready a little after shooting time, but very few ducks were flying. The morning was very slow but pretty. The varieties of clouds and the fresh wind from the southwest showed the pond at its best. I had brought out extra brush and concealed myself well. I spent the first two hours enjoying the view and watching the terns as the circled and dove into the pond for fish. I called in a widgeon that landed opposite the decoys but never came within range. Around 9:00 o'clock I moved the decoys. Shortly after that, three mallards came over the island. I downed a drake and Daisy made a solid retrieve. After this nothing was flying so I left the blind at 10:15.

Except for Clay Judd and Don Broemsamle at \#3 (six mallards) results were slim all over the club. Mike Monteith at \#7 and Dean at \#9 each got one spoonie; Paul Dali at \#5 and Jeff Smith at \#6 were skunked. Al White got two mallards at \#14 (and two more mice in his room). Tom Lucas and his son had some shooting at \#2.

Bag: 1 mallard.

Other: Don B. blew revile at 4:15 on Al White's bugle.

\-----

Wednesday, November 4th: New arrivals.

Tuesday afternoon was warm with a 10-15 mph wind from the north and a sky so crystal clear that I could see Mt. Hamilton from the Grizzly Island Road. Daisy and I walked along the west side but except for a large "V" or two high in the distance, we saw no ducks.

I went back to \#8 on Wednesday morning. The sky was partly cloudy and, contrary to the forecast, windless. No ducks were flying at shooting time. However, I began to see ducks about 7:00 o'clock. I called in a flock of ducks and shot one that turned out to be a spoonie. Spoonies rarely fly in flocks; they only do so when they're migrating. Later on I called in another flock of spoonies and let them go. There were other indications of new arrivals from the north: two flocks of geese, high-flying flocks of mallards and widgeon and generally, more ducks than I had seen the previous Saturday. I came in at 10:30.

Bag: 1 spoonie.

Other: On Tuesday afternoon's walk, Daisy had lost one of her dummies in the tulles across the canal opposite the turkey pen. Joe's dog Rascal, a friendly mixed-breed shepherd, distracted her during a double retrieve. I took her over in the boat on Wednesday and she found it.

On Tuesday evening after dinner, I saw a large brown owl on the clubhouse roof.

Bob Voydat and Jim Jacobsen each did well on mallards. Bob said his mallards were northern birds.

\-----

Wednesday, November 11th: Daisy's stellar performance.

Why even bother to go duck hunting when (1) the weather is clear, (2) there's virtually no wind, (3) the moon is full, (4) the marsh holds only a few ducks and (5) you the lowest blind choice? Answer: sometimes there are unexpected rewards.

Tuesday afternoon was clear and mild (65 degrees) with a fresh north breeze. There were fewer mosquitoes. Daisy and I walked along the west side and saw a few ducks in the air and settled along the shore between \#7 and \#8. We saw our first sprig of the season.

I hadn't shot Blind \#10 for several years and decided to try it with Daisy. The island is small, damp and not really suitable for a dog; Daisy spent the morning huddled on the dog stand.

There was very little action. By 9:00 o'clock I had fired one round at a pair of mallards at extreme (to put it charitably) range and had resigned myself to being skunked. Then I saw a duck circling around \#11. I used the widgeon call to bring it over the decoys and although its bright color led me to suspect it was a drake spoonie, I fired and hit it with my first shot. It gradually lost altitude and landed about 250 yards east of the blind. Daisy marked it and started out. Meanwhile, the duck swam away toward the grass by the entrance to old blind \#11. The distance was such that I had to use my field glasses to keep the duck in sight. Daisy finally closed on it and chased it out into the middle of the pond. The duck dove six or seven times but Daisy persevered and finally caught it. After a long swim back to the blind she delivered a widgeon drake to hand. This was by far her best retrieve this season and one of her finest ever. But even better was in store.

Around 10:30 I picked up the decoys and took a boat ride to \#8 to see how Bill Armstrong was doing. Bill said he had a bird down between the blind and the clubhouse. I took Daisy to an area of heavy cover and told her, "hunt the bird." She hunted the area and suddenly became "birdy." Ten feet ahead of her a wing fluttered in the tall grass. Daisy went forward and picked up a crippled hen mallard. This was her first find for another hunter, a notable achievement. Needless to say, I considered the morning a great success despite the small take.

Tom Lucas, Jim Jacobsen and Clay Judd are continuing to do very well on mallards. Doug Alberger also got two mallards at \#1. (Who said \#1 isn't a fair weather blind?)

Bag: 1 widgeon.

Other: Bill said the owl was gone last Friday and I didn't hear it Tuesday evening. However, it was hooting at 3:00 a.m Wednesday morning.

Dean brought Mike Ryan as his guest. It was good seeing Mike and his dog Heidi. They got 1 spoonie at \#3.

Joe's Tuesday dinner featured perfectly barbecued sirloin steaks.

\-----

Saturday, November 14th: End of Act I.

Friday's hazy and languid afternoon mirrored last season's weather at its worst. The lack of storms is worrisome. Daisy and I walked along the east side and saw a few ducks on the state property.

In the morning I went back to \#8. I'd been accumulating brush there and was able to conceal myself quite well. The sky was clear but a fresh 10-15 mph wind was blowing from the northeast-northwest quadrant. During the first hour I had more birds over the blind than at anytime this season. Early on I brought down a hen widgeon which fell dead about 70 yards from the blind. Daisy made a routine retrieve.

I fired many rounds at ducks which were working the decoys at extreme range and started to worry about running out of ammunition. (I had taken only 25 shells and 3 goose loads out to the blind.) After 8:00 o'clock very few ducks were flying. However, a teal landed in the pond a little beyond the decoys. I fired at it and, after it flew up, hit it with my second shot. The teal landed in the pond and swam to the grass on the north shore. Daisy searched back and forth in the tall grass for a long time. Then I saw the duck swimming toward my decoys. Daisy responded to my whistle and saw the duck when she started swimming back to the blind. It dove on her many times but she stayed with it and finally got it; this was her second outstanding retrieve of the season. After this I had a few more ducks working the decoys but no real opportunities. I was blindsided by a pair of mallards that flew right over the island.

After lunch Fred Ellers took us out to the sloughs behind Blind \#5 to look for a downed mallard. Daisy and I spent about an hour wading around but were unsuccessful.

Bag: 1 widgeon and 1 teal.

Other: Joe served excellent Cornish game hens on Friday night.

Our owl was quiet at bedtime but in full voice at 3:00 in the morning.

Al White's season total is now 13 (mice, that is).

\_____\_

Saturday, December 5th: That's more like it!

The drought began to ease during the three week interval. My rain gauge received 0.14 inches the week before Thanksgiving and 0.98 inch over December 2d and 3rd. It was also much cooler. Driving through the hills west of Fairfiled I observed the first hint of new green grass. I could hardly wait to get back to Sprig Farm.

Friday's weather was cool and fresh, 62 degrees with a gentle breeze from the south. There were many ducks in the ponds alongside Grizzly Island Road near its intersection with Highway 12. Walking along the east side I saw many new birds in the air and on the state property.

I had first choice and didn't want to waste it, so I went to \#8. The morning was partly cloudy, crisp and a 10 mph. wind was blowing from the northeast. I was ready just after shooting time and about 10 minutes later, the sky filled with ducks, more flights than I could keep track of at one time. I fired at a bird 30 yards overhead and brought it down -- a coot! I was surprised and a little chagrined and then I saw many coots flying higher than I've ever seen them. I remembered hearing that pilots had seen migrating coots as high as 4000 feet.

Until 8:30 the action was terrific. There were plenty of teal and I enjoyed calling them in. I called in and lost sight of one flock of teal that circled behind me as close as 5 yards. I shot three teal; Daisy made two routine retrieves and one excellent effort. The duck went down near the grass between the island and the clubhouse. Daisy set out on a direct line. She veered of to the right about 50 yards from the edge of the pond, and was well downwind when she reached the grass. She then worked upwind and found the bird.

I passed up a number of other opportunities for teal in the hope of getting a chance for a big duck. This was a mistake. Always take any good duck which the marsh offers. Around 8:30, the action slowed to a halt. I picked up at 9:30 and met Jim Graziani at St. Germain's \#28 pond (opposite the east end of \#1 pond.) We had coffee while Daisy and Bandit, Jim's Brittany Spaniel, frolicked around the area. All in all, it was a very satisfying morning.

Other:

Dean bought a 25 hp. motor; he almost flies down the canal and is afraid to give it full throttle.

Fred Ellers put a hobby store electric motor on a decoy. According to Fred, it didn't work that well but knowing Fred, he will probably persevere until he gets it right. He got 3 widgeon and a teal at \#7.

Bag: 3 teal.

Joe said a weasel killed his four turkeys and six chickens.

Jim Jacobsen and Clay Judd again got six mallards at \#14.

\-----

Wednesday, December 9th: Never wetter.

Nearly an inch of rain fell on Sunday and Monday as the drought continued to recede. On Tuesday afternoon's drive to the club, it rained lightly almost all the way and the hills were noticeably greener. Fred Ellers followed me in and when we stopped alongside the D.U. ponds, at least fifty big ducks got up. The rain let up about 4:00 o'clock and after pumping out my boat, I took Daisy for a walk along the east side where she chased several rabbits.

The rain started again at dinner time, wasn't too heavy on our after dinner walk to the gate but got heavier throughout the night. On Wednesday morning I went to Blind \#7. A cold wind was blowing from the east. I took my time and was ready about 7:15. This didn't matter because there was a fog and nothing was flying. The rain continued to fall and I had to keep facing downwind to keep my glasses dry. The rain dripped off my hat and down my back, and I felt very cold. A little before 8:00 o'clock a teal landed near the decoys. I got it with the first shot and Daisy made a routine retrieve. Around 9:00 o'clock I went in to warm up and put on some dry clothes. Al White and Jim Jacobsen had already come in from \#14. I stayed in the clubhouse until 10:30 and then went back to the pond and stayed there till 11:45. It was still raining. I saw a few ducks flying and missed three shots at a sprig that came over the decoys. I fell in while I was getting into the boat. When I reached the clubhouse, everybody except Al White had finished lunch and gone home. Alan came in around 1:15. Everyone is of course grateful for the rain, but in combination with the fog, it made shooting conditions miserable.

Bag: 1 teal.

Other: Jeff Smith and his guest got a mixed bag of 5 ducks at \#5A: Tom Lucas got 2 mallards at \#1 and Dean got a teal at \#8. Alan and Jim were skunked at \#14.

\----

Saturday, December 12th: Slow motion morning.

The last showers of the week's storms fell on Friday afternoon. Walking along the west side I saw a few large flocks in the sky but virtually nothing on our ponds.

That evening we entertained 18 guests from St. Germain. The cocktail hour appitizers consisted of fresh shrimp, cracked crab, Muriel's fritatta, guacamole, chips, cold meats, cheeses and a variety of crackers. Mike Monteith and Alan White prepared the main course, barbecued chicken, tortollini with pesto sauce, fettucini with tomato sauce and salad. The desert was outstanding, Tiramisu prepared by St. Germain's chef from Jim Graziani's recipe. In relation to the quantity of food, appropriate measures of wines and spirits were also consumed. The fun and fellowship matched the quality of the food and it was altogether a most enjoyable evening.

Saturday morning was a afterthought. Most of us were operating in slow motion after the previous evening's festivities. (A few had played dominoes until 1:00 a.m.) In any event, the morning was crystal clear with a waning moon setting over the hills. The scenery was beautiful. I had a low choice and went to \#5. I saw no reason to hurry and wasn't ready until sunrise. Big flocks of ducks at were flying at least 1000 feet high but nothing came near the blind. Around 9:00 o'clock I was surprised to see a teal in my decoys. I stood up and when the bird flared, I brought it down with my second shot. The bird swam about 100 yards from the blind and started diving when Daisy approached but she stayed with it caught it by putting her head underwater. Another excellent retrieve.

The morning's shooting was extremely slow all over the club except for - you guessed it - Clay Judd and Jim Jacobsen at \#3. Mike Monteith and Winn Oliver got skunked at \#14. Fred Ellers got two teal at \#8. Peter Svenson said he had a number of opportunities at \#9.

Bag: 1 teal.

Other: While the party was in full swing, a horde of mice invaded the kitchen. Alan and Mike saw at least 15 scampering around the drainboard. Someone mentioned the movie "Willard."

\------

Wednesday, December 16th: Excitement in the air.

Three days of dry weather and northerly winds brought the ducks back to the marsh. Tuesday afternoon was crisp, clear and altogether delightful. Daisy and I walked along the west side and saw some ducks on our ponds and quite a number on the state ponds opposite \#5A. We also saw flocks of geese flying back and forth and landing on the state property.

Even the weather forecast for Wednesday was exciting: a small craft advisory for 10-20 mph winds on Suisun Bay, starting in the north and changing to south, followed by an incoming storm ahead of a mass of very cold air. In the morning I went to \#8 and was ready at shooting time. Conditions were cool and pleasant. The winds were light and generally from the northerly quadrant and the sky was lightly overcast with the beginning of the high clouds which precede a storm front.

The ducks started flying about 15 minutes after shooting time and there was plenty to watch until 9:30, including several flocks of geese, one of which came right overhead about 100 yards high. I moved my decoys twice but never felt I had the right placement. No big birds came in shooting range but the teal gave me a number of opportunities and I got three. I also did well recognizing spoonies and holding fire.

One of my teal went down in the grass east of the blind and I went over to help Daisy find it. When she saw me coming she coursed back and forth as though we were hunting pheasants and she "froze" when she got near the bird. I told her "get the bird" and she did. I decided to go in about 10:30 but the ducks started flying again and I stayed out in the blind another half hour.

Bag: 3 teal.

Other: Clay Judd got a goose at \#14. Alan White got three greenheads and a sprig at \#3. Bob Voydat got skunked at \#7; however, he had no reason to complain because he had passed up many opportunities for teal.

When Bill Armstrong stepped out of his trailer at 2:00 a.m., an owl swooped within a foot or two of his face and glided silently down the canal. There are in fact two owls living at the club and they've been named "Hoot" and "Toot."

\------

Saturday, December 19th: Lessons relearned.

A freeze was predicted for Friday night and the air was noticeably colder when I arrived at Sprig Farm. I kept Daisy out of the water in the afternoon and we took a shorter than usual walk along the west side, seeing more ducks than at any time this season.

Saturday morning was cold, clear and calm, but the temperature hadn't fallen below 38 degrees. I went back to \#8 put a dozen sprig and mallard decoys along the north side of the pond opposite the blind, and another 10 mallard decoys along the east edge. I had used this pattern in previous years and wondered why I had recently forgotten it. While setting the decoys I heard an owl hooting; it was probably in the barn by the gate.

I was ready at shooting time but the ducks weren't. Despite the numbers of ducks I had seen the previous afternoon very few were flying. A little before sunrise three large, colorful ducks worked the decoys. One shot -- one down; it was a drake spoonie. I should have known better. I was so upset about shooting a spoonie that when the next flock came in I held fire and didn't recognize that long, thin tail on the drake until it was too late. After that, the action was extremely slow. I made the most of three chances at widgeon which worked the decoys and, with eight rounds expended, got my first limit of the season. Daisy had an easy morning because all four ducks fell dead close to the island.

This morning I relearned a number of lessons that should have been ingrained after 11 years of duck hunting: (1) Seeing lots of ducks in the afternoon doesn't guarantee they'll be there next morning. (2) Spoonie drakes are extremely tempting; beware of brightly colored ducks in dim light. (3) At \#8 some decoys should be placed around the north and east edges of the pond (if the wind is from the south, put them along the east and south sides). (4) When it's dark I tend to put the decoys too close to each other. (5) Good gun mount, good sight picture, moving gun and follow-through equals shot on the target.

Bag: 3 widgeon and 1 spoonie.

Other: Fred Ellers got a beautiful limit at \#1, two big mallards and two teal.

Bill Armstrong has been taking Rascal out with him. Rascal stays quiet in the blind but hasn't made any retrieves yet. Also, Bill heard coyotes howling Friday night.

I saw the tulle elk herd Friday afternoon about 300 yards east of the check stand.

\-----

Wednesday, December 23rd: Pea soup.

I arrived at Sprig Farm shortly after sunset in time enough to walk Daisy out to the gate and back. I heard the calls of ducks and geese on the property and saw a few flocks flying in the fading light. It was cold, breezy and clear, but there was just a hint of moisture in the air and when Bill asked at dinner whether the morning would be foggy, I shouldn't have replied "no" so quickly. The fog settled in about 1:00 a.m. and when I got up 5:00, the radio was reporting one eighth mile (200 yards) visibility at Fairfield.

I had the last blind draw and picked \#1, but Craig Young decided to shoot \#5A with Jim Jacobsen, so \#8 became available. I went there and set the decoys as I had the previous time.

The morning was -- in one word -- raw, temperature below 40, hard 20 mph wind from the east, and damp fog with 200 yards visibility. The time passed fairly quickly because there were a few ducks in the air and I could see far enough down the pond to be ready for them. Also, I kept watching for indications that the fog might lift; it didn't. Early on, a large duck came by the blind. I fired one shot, it fluttered its wings, flew on and then suddenly dropped in the nut grass about 150 yards east of the island. Fearing that once again I had fallen prey to the drake spoonie temptation, I took Daisy to the spot where she pointed and then picked up a drake sprig.

Our next efforts weren't so rewarding, Twice I brought down teal which we lost. They both landed in the pond; one dove, the other swam to the far shore. We hunted each of them for 15 minutes or so but couldn't find them. I know it wasn't easy for Daisy in the wind and cold water. Around 10:30 I shot another teal which fell dead near the island and she made a routine retrieve. During the morning I passed up several shots at spoonies and one at a hen mallard which I didn't identify until too late. However, I'm not too upset about passing up shots at hens. At 10:45, cold and tired, I went in and later really enjoyed Joe's lunch of spaghetti and meat balls with garlic bread and salad.

Bag: 1 sprig and 1 teal.

Reflection: In sporitng clays and skeet competition, the referee calls "dead bird" if he sees the slightest chip come off the target. This rule doesn't apply on the marsh. Until Daisy has more experience marking in foggy weather I should fire a second shot at a falling wounded bird.

Other: Alan White continues to do well on mallards and his mouse count is now 18.

Craig had done me a favor by changing to \#5A and I was happy to learn that he had a good shoot.

Joe told Bill that some nights when he's alone, he hears footsteps and doors closing upstairs; he thinks the clubhouse is haunted.

I had the teal for dinner on Wednesday. Here's a quick, easy recipe for teal that doesn't involve cleaning a greasy oven. Split the bird in half, sprinkle with salt and pepper and a little paprika, broil the halves on an electric grill like a Farberware or Rotisserie, skin side to the heat for 12-14 minutes, bone side 5 minutes.

\-----

Sunday, December 27th: Pea Soup II.

This was essentially a reprise of Wednesday's hunt. When I arrived at Sprig Farm shortly before dinner on Saturday evening the fog had already settled in. However, horizontal visibility was at least a mile and remained that way all night. The fog thickened somewhat in the morning but from \#8 I could discern the outline of the clubhouse and the telephone poles along the road. This works out to about a quarter mile visibility. The wind was hard from the east and the temperature was 33 degrees with a wind chill factor of 20.

I set plenty of decoys around the north and east shores; this works very well when combined with a "hook" leading out from the island. I'm now confident that I can "fine tune" \#8 pond for winter shooting conditions.

Though slow, the morning provided several interesting experiences. A formation of fifteen swans flew right over the blind and two flocks of spoonies landed in the decoys. I started badly, missing three shots at two sprig which came wing-set into the decoys. However, I redeemed myself when another pair of sprig came along; I called them over the decoys and they circled around the island when they flared. I dropped the drake with a one round; it fell 50 yards east of the island and Daisy made a routine retrieve. Later I shot a hen canvasback which Daisy also fetched. At 11:00 o'clock I went back to the clubhouse cold but contented.

Bag: 1 canvasback and 1 sprig.

Other: Alan White and Mitch got 2 gadwall at \#3.

There are now plenty of sprig on the club ponds.

The water level is getting very low. At the dock I had to kneel to get in and out of the boat. Tom Lucas reported that \#1 pond had almost dried up.

\-----

Wednesday, December 30th: Winter reverie.

The water level was back to normal on Tuesday afternoon. Daisy's adventures began the moment we arrived at the club. As she got out of the Jeep her hackles went up and she ran after a grey shape that disappeared under the kitchen steps.

Our afternoon walk was spectacular. A storm front had passed over the marsh and was bringing blizzard conditions to the Sierras. The brisk wind was exhilarating and the sky, filled with many types of clouds, looked like a page in a meteorology textbook. Our west side ponds were sheltering a few ducks and some flocks were working the state ponds. On the way back to the club house we were caught in a rain shower.

There's little to say about the morning shoot. Although the air was clear and the view terriffic, I've never seen a slower December morning. Our eight hunters shot seven ducks. I was fortunate to hit the two widgeon which came to my decoys at blind \#8. The most likely explanation for the poor shooting is that the storm chased most of the ducks off the marsh.

Bag: two widgeon.

Other: Dean fired only one shell Wednesday morning -- and killed a rat on the fence behind the barbecue porch.

Bill Armstrong was high gun at \#10 with 2 widgeon and 1 gadwall. He took Rascal along. Rascal caught a rat on the island and behaved well until Bill shot his first duck. Then Rascal went out, sniffed the downed duck, and went back over the bridge to the clubhouse.

\-----

Saturday, January 2d: What might have been.

I spent New Year's Day most enjoyably by taking a long walk with Daisy along the east side road in the brisk winter air. The marsh was at its freshest best after the recent storms. We saw a few ducks and some geese on the state property but nothing over the club. During the cocktail hour I watched football and helped consume Mike's special appitizer, a hollowed out loaf of french bread filled with brie cheese, butter and nuts, which he heated in the oven for about 20 minutes.

I had a low pick but got \#8 again. The morning was partly cloudy with variable winds, mostly from the west. There was virtually nothing flying and yet, with a little luck and more shooting skill, I could have had a limit of fine birds. To explain, a little after shooting time, a flock of seven sprig flew out of the east and came wing-set outside my line of decoys. I didn't seem them until they were over the pond and couldn't tell whether they were in range. I called them back and they came by at what looked to me like marginal range. I held fire and they landed in the middle of the pond. Had they a few yards closer I would have fired and might have gotten one.

Around 8:00 a mallard pair came wing-set to my decoys, circled the east edge of the pond and flew over the island. I missed my first shot, downed the hen with my second, but by this time it was too late to shoot at the drake. Had I hit with my first shot, I would have had an excellent chance for a double. Daisy made a routine 40 yard retrieve. About 9:45 just after I finished my hot chocolate, another pair of mallards came right over the island. Had I been looking in the right direction, I would have seen them in time to fire three rounds at the drake. In any event, I felt lucky to have taken one big duck on an extremely slow morning when nearly everybody else got skunked. (Well, not quite everybody, Clay Judd and Jim Jacobsen got 5 mallards at \#14.)

Bag: one mallard.

Other: At twilight Bill and I saw the owl fly off the clubhouse roof; I saw it again in the morning when it flew over the island.

We had spaghetti and meat sauce for lunch. There was a mouse in the corner of the dining room.

Wednesday, January 6th: Exceptio probat regulum[^2].

[^2]: Tr. An exception confirms the rule.

According to local weather lore, a south wind brings rain and a north wind clear weather. Tuesday afternoon's sky was overcast, with a light fog on the marsh and a cold wind out of the east. Heavy rains with strong southerly winds were forecast for the morning. Accordingly, when Clay Judd asked me the next morning's wind, I confidently replied, "Certainly from the south or southeast."

Tuesday afternoon was so cold that Daisy and I walked only a half-mile out along the east side road. We saw many ducks on the state ponds but most of them were spoonies. It started to rain as we neared the clubhouse. After Tuesday's dinner (an excellent pot roast), I picked blind \#8 and was visualizing how I would decoy the pond for the south wind. I'm convinced that \#8, together with \#3 and \#10, are our best south wind blinds.

I slept well Tuesday night, serenaded by the sounds of a strong wind. When I awoke the fog had lifted and the rain was light. However, a look at the weather vane brought a surprise. The arrow was pointing north! When Clay reminded me of Tuesday's prediction, I replied that one of the joys of duck hunting is experiencing the unexpected.

On Wednesday morning there were so many ducks in the grey cloud-filled sky that it brought back memories of the early '80's. However, blind \#8 isn't easy to shoot in a north wind because the ducks head for the north shore of the pond half way to \#7. I watched many big ducks land well out of range. Two widgeon did swim across the pond to about seventy yards downwind from the island but I didn't try to flare them. Only the teal and the spoonies came over my island. I called in and shot two teal but missed several others.

My shooting was mediocre but Daisy was brilliant. One the teal was a diver; Daisy persevered until she caught it. The second bird fell as though dead, then stretched its wings and skimmed the surface of the pond for about 200 yards before landing and swimming into the grass two thirds of the way to \#7. We made our way across the pond and hunted the area for some time until the bird rose up, flew a short distance, and disappeared into thick cover. After working the area for another ten minutes, Daisy "froze." When I ordered her forward, she literally burrowed into some matted grass and recovered the still lively duck. This retrieve -- her career best -- was as satisfying as a limit of big mallards (well, almost as satisfying.) Cold and wet, I returned to enjoy Joe's lunch of hearty clam chowder and sandwiches.

Bag: two teal.

Other: Despite his complaints about my weather prediction, Clay Judd didn't fare so badly, three mallards at \#15. Fred Ellers had good shooting at \#9 and Dean got two teal and a spoonie at \#1 without using any decoys.

There were two pheasants at the club gate on Wednesday afternoon.

Saturday, January 9th: A very quiet finish.

There were plenty of spoonies all over the marsh on Friday afternoon but few other ducks. Shortly after we arrived at the club a heavy rain squall swept across the marsh but the sky cleared around 4:00 p.m. Our walk along the west side was scenic and enjoyable but, except for a few spoonies, there were virtually no ducks on our ponds. Using the field glasses I could see large numbers of ducks on the state ponds half a mile in from our east side.

Friday's dinner featured beautifully barbecued filet mignon. Muriel's plum pudding, this year using a recipe in a British cookbook published in 1914, was heartily enjoyed. After dinner I drew fourth choice and picked blind \#8.

Saturday morning presented a beautiful but empty sky at \#8 except for one flock of teal which flew unscathed through my barrage. Fred Ellers visited the pond and shot some video of Daisy and me on the island. Dean was high gun with one spoonie. Al White summed it up, "I didn't know the season ended on Wednesday."

It was a quiet end to a season which though light on shooting, weatherwise, had been extremely interesting. Thanks to the plentiful rain, we had enjoyed the best scenery in recent years and this was some compensation for the slow shooting on most mornings. Fortunately, the food and fellowship in the clubhouse kept the enjoyment level high thoughout the season. I'll miss Sprig Farm in the coming months but I'm hopeful that this winter's abundant rain will revive the marsh and so bring some more ducks our way next fall.

Season total: Mallard - 4

Sprig - 2

Canvasback - 1

Teal - 13

Widgeon - 7
