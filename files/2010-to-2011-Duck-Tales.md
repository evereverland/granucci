**Introduction**

The off season months seemed to fly by. This year I took John and his family to England and had the pleasure of seeing familiar sights through new eyes. However, as summer faded into fall, I began to wonder whether the coming duck season would be any better than the previous one which began badly and went downhill from there. And would Ivy, now in her eleventh year, still be able to perform? And would I still be physically up to the challenges of duck hunting? I’d come home from many of last year’s outings exhausted and discouraged about my shooting. In early October I participated in the World Skeet Championships at San Antonio. Eight days and a thousand plus targets later, I returned home more confident about my shooting.

**Saturday, October 23, 2010: Opening Day**

I went to the club on Thursday, October 21st, a day early. We crossed the river at 2:00 o’clock under a sky covered with high and mid level clouds, the temperature a mild 69 degrees. On arriving, I found that Jarred and Erik Cushman had already installed my outboard motor in the boat, a much appreciated favor. I spent the afternoon cleaning the boat, stowing my equipment on board and afterward took it out for a test run. Everything was fine. Then I took a walk with Ivy and watched many ducks flying in the northwest and eastern skies.

We had cocktails in the clubroom while watching the Giants in the playoffs and afterward sat down to a dinner of roast chicken, baked potatoes and sautéed asparagus, with coconut ice cream with chocolate sauce for dessert.

Friday was as pleasant a day as I’ve ever spent on the marsh. I slept in until 7:10. After breakfast I walked with Ivy out to the gate and observed several mallards resting on \#1 pond. Our presence didn’t disturb them. I put the decoys in my boat and then read until lunch, hot dogs with the usual trimmings plus sautéed onions. At 2:00 o’clock a rain shower prompted me to postpone Ivy’s afternoon walk until 4:00. By then sky had partially cleared and a fresh wind was blowing from the west. The ducks I saw flying all day gave me hope that this year’s Opening Day would be a marked improvement over last year’s fiasco.

Nineteen exuberant hunters gathered around the dinner table on Friday evening. Our menu featured New York strip roast prepared in the Chinese smoker, sautéed green beans, roasted red potatoes and a very rich chocolate cake for dessert. In our post-dinner blind draw I drew fifth choice.

At bed time the full moon was shining though a layer of middle level clouds with the temperature still mild. The wind was from the southwest at 5 mph. There were rain showers during the night and more were forecast for the morning; a few drops were falling at 5:00 a.m. when I went out to rouse Ivy. The wind had shifted to the south.

I went to blind \#1, set nine mallard decoys in twos and threes around the pond and settled into the barrel. The wind was very light but the sky, covered with mid-level clouds, was ideal for duck hunting. Rain was falling here and there in the surrounding hills. There were quite a few ducks in the air. A number of them came toward my decoys but turned off about 70 yards away; several other hunters had this experience.

I started badly, firing seven cartridges at ducks that were either out of range or not given enough lead. Finally, my eighth shot solidly hit a large drake mallard that fell fifteen yards from the blind, an easy retrieve for Ivy. Fifteen minutes later I hit an even larger drake mallard. It fell in the pond about seventeen yards out and dove under the water. I watched closely and when it surfaced, hit it with another charge of shot. As Ivy went out it swam slowly away and tried to dive, but she quickly caught it. Around 9:15 a hen widgeon dove toward my decoys and flared when I stood up. I hit it solidly; it came down in the water about thirty-five yards to the northwest and lay still. Ivy went right to it and brought it to hand. As compared to other opening days, I heard very few shots fired. It’s possible that the full moon had given the ducks enough light to feed during the night so that they didn’t have to fly as much in the morning.

I’d told myself that I’d be satisfied with two or three good ducks on Opening Day. At 9:30, I picked up and went in, highly pleased that this morning was the complete opposite of last year’s opener.

We had Tuscan bean and tuna salad for lunch.

Everyone brought in an average of three or four ducks. However, Andy Stone and Corey Abel each limited at blind \#15. They reported that the muddy pond bottom made decoy setting extremely difficult. Andy’s dog Skoal saved the day by retrieving all their ducks.

On Saturday afternoon Ivy and I returned home from our opening shoot feeling tired but not exhausted. On Sunday Ivy showed no ill effects from her previous day’s exertions, probably because I’d shot conservatively and the ducks had fallen near the blind. I resolved to continue this practice.

Heavy rain fell on Sunday and very few ducks were taken at the club except for Erik Cushman, who went out to blind \#16 and bagged seven ducks in half an hour.

Bag: two mallards and one widgeon for fourteen cartridges.[^1]

[^1]: In order to make things easier for Ivy, I decided to shoot downed ducks on the water if they showed much sign of life. I’d previously let her run (or swim) them down. Accordingly, cartridges fired to disable downed ducks will no longer figure in my per-bird average.

**Wednesday, October 27, 2010:  “Mayday! Mayday!”**

This call came in at 11:00 o’clock on Wednesday morning from Marc Pasquini at blind \#8. His outboard motor had overheated. Harlan went out in the club boat and towed him in.

Sunday’s rain was followed by fair weather on Tuesday. That afternoon the air was so clear that we could see the outline of the Sierras from the rise near Bay Point. We crossed the river at 4:00 o’clock, there was no wind and the water was mirror-smooth. Ivy and I walked the half-mile out to the gate and saw a number of ducks in the air, some of them landing on our property.

After the customary green salad, we dined on roast leg of lamb, roasted potatoes and Swiss chard sautéed with garlic, which I particularly enjoyed. Two bottles of Burgundy, Louis Jadot 2007 Pinot Noir, contributed by George Couch, Jim Graziani’s guest, provided further enjoyment. Dessert was pumpkin pie with whipped cream.

On Wednesday morning the sky was clear, with only the faintest breeze from the east. I picked blind \#16, where Erik Cushman had taken his limit on Sunday. As I boated out to the blind in the first light, it felt wonderful to be out on the marsh.

I put out nine decoys (three pairs and one threesome) and settled into the barrel. By this time the wind had freshened to about 5 mph. from the east. The mallards seemed to like the spread but I started badly, missing two shots at the first one, and hitting the second one but not hard enough. It sailed across the pond and landed in the rushes about 160 yards across the pond. I felt it would be futile to send Ivy. The third time was the charm. I solidly hit a hen mallard about 40 yards overhead. It kept flapping its wings but lost altitude and I heard it plop on the water behind a stand of tulles about 30 yards northeast of the blind. Ivy swam out, disappeared behind the tulles and came around the other side with the lifeless bird in her mouth. After that, I was content to watch the ducks flying around. I was thrilled to watch a large flock of pintails circling around blind \#12, where Frank Fiala and Mike Corsetti were shooting. They kept getting closer to the blind until gunfire at another club scared them off. At 9:15, a flock of what looked like teal flew into the pond, I called them into range, fired, and with my second shot put one down on the water about fifteen yards from the barrel. It was swimming so I reloaded and fired a disabling shot; Ivy made an easy retrieve of what to my disappointment turned out be a hen spoonie. At 9:45 I picked up and took a pleasant ride back to the dock. By this time, the wind had shifted to the north and had become so strong that I had trouble gathering up my decoys.

Abe greeted the returning hunters with an outstanding potato, leek and onion soup followed by generous grilled pastrami and cheese sandwiches for lunch and chocolate dipped strawberries for dessert.

Frank Fiala shot brilliantly, six ducks for as many cartridges, with two doubles. Richard Vaccari also enjoyed great success; he caught two large stripped bass on Tuesday afternoon and got six ducks at blind \#26 on Wednesday. Marc got skunked, likewise Jim Graziani and George Couch and blind \#10.

**Saturday, October 30, 2010: Restraint Rewarded**

On Friday afternoon we crossed the river at 4:00 o’clock under an overcast sky with the cloud base at 4,000 feet, a light wind from the southwest and temperature in the high 60’s. The forecast called for scattered showers during the night and next morning. I took Ivy out for a walk but when we were half way to the gate the mosquitoes chased us back. Looking toward the eastern hills with my binoculars I saw hundreds of ducks in the air; they were too far away to be seen by the naked eye.

Dinner started with an excellent Caesar salad, the main course being roast loin of pork, steamed broccoli and baked potatoes and yams, and apple pie *a la mode* for dessert.

On Saturday morning I went out to rouse Ivy at 5:15. The wind had shifted to the south and I felt a drop or two of rain. These conditions made blind \#1 an ideal choice; also, the hunt was going to be short because we had to leave the club by noon to catch the tide.

I was ready for action six minutes after shooting time but very little was flying. Two or three pairs of mallards passed by my blind at 50 yards; previously I might have taken a chance at them but I remembered my resolution to shoot more conservatively for Ivy’s sake and held fire.

I’d originally loaded Hevi-Shot no. 6’s but changed to 4’s. It was a good move because a short time later, a pair of mallards circled the pond 30 yards high; I blew some short calls and when they came into range, focused on one, gave it what looked like the correct lead and pressed the trigger. The duck folded, dropped straight down and lay still on the water. Ivy made an easy retrieve. Later I saw what looked like four geese approaching the blind very low. They were actually white swans and it was thrilling to see them pass so close.

The sky remained overcast during the morning and with only the lightest of breezes from variable directions. At 8:40 I picked up and went in. We ate a hurried lunch of chicken pot pie and left the dock at 11:45.

Other: Tim Murphy and Mike Corsetti bagged a mallard and a gadwall at blind \#12: Kurt Koeppen got a mallard, a widgeon and a spoonie at blind \#8 and Steve Martinelli, a coot at blind \#26.

**Wednesday, November 3, 2010: Start of the Slowdown**

Two weeks into the season the local ducks have become very wary and the usually mild weather gives the migratory birds in the north no reason to fly south. This early season slowdown is a fact of life on the marsh and new ducks aren’t expected to arrive until Thanksgiving.

Tuesday was clear and warm. We crossed the river at 2:00 o’clock and when we arrived, Harlan reported that there were some ducks on the property. I didn’t see any on my walk with Ivy; we went only half the usual distance because of the heat. Dinner featured chicken breasts roasted with rosemary and garlic, roasted Anaheim peppers, sautéed green beans and rice, with an excellent home-made banana cake for dessert.

The temperature, still fairly warm when I settled Ivy down for the night, cooled somewhat during the night and was mild in the morning. I invited Marc to join me at blind \#12. The wind was from the east at 5 mph and the sky was decorated with cirrus clouds that glowed pink at sunrise.

About fifteen minutes after shooting time Marc, who was at the outer blind, shot a duck that came down about 50 yards to his left. I thought it was a mallard but when Ivy brought it in, it turned out to be a spoonie. Later I was mesmerized by a large flock of teal that came to my call and flew overhead well within range. I held fire. I also declined to fire at several spoonies that came by. During the morning we watched a number of mallards circle well out of range before landing in the area opposite blind \#13.

The temperature grew warmer. I picked up and went in at 9:45 with all my cartridges; Marc stayed out a while longer; his single spoonie made him high Gun for the day.

We had a salad with leftover lamb and pork slices and crossed back to McAvoy at 1:00 o’clock.

Bag: skunked, no rounds fired.

**Wednesday, November 10, 2010: Spectacle in the Sky**

I skipped Saturday’s hunt and went to the Stanford-Arizona game. Our team played brilliantly and I didn’t regret my decision, even after learning that those at the club had enjoyed fairly good hunting.

Tuesday afternoon was mild. We crossed the river at 3:00 o’clock under a cover of mid level clouds that preceded a cold front approaching from the northwest. The wind was from the southwest at the temperature in the 60’s. On my walk with Ivy out to the gate I saw quite a few mallards resting in the area of \#1 pond.

Conditions at the club were primitive due to a leak in our water processing system. We had to use bottled water for cooking and wash ourselves in the plucking shed with the cold unprocessed water normally used for cleaning ducks. Ivy drank bottled water.

Dinner featured baked halibut from my Alaska fishing trip with George Couch and Jim Koeppen. Abe served the fish with rice and sautéed chard and home-made dill sauce. Dessert was a scarlet mousse cake.

Light rain began falling during the cocktail hour and it continued on and off during the night. By morning the front had passed and when I went out to wake Ivy the stars were shining brilliantly. There was a brisk wind from the northwest. I originally intended to go to blind \#13. The boat ditch was clogged with tulle cuttings making it difficult to get through. At the blind the wind was blowing in my face so I moved to blind \#16. I had one chance when a pair of mallards approached the island, when they flared off I fired two shots but missed. I can’ say whether they were out of range or I’d given them insufficient lead.

During the morning I watched a parade of large flocks of ducks heading westward from the valley, so high they could barely be seen with the naked eye. There must have been over a thousand of them. I was glad to have my binoculars.

I went in at 9:30. We had linguini and meat sauce for lunch.

Other: Mike Corsetti’s three mallards (and one spoonie) made him high Gun for the day; Steve Martinelli bagged a mallard and Richard Vaccari, one widgeon and one spoonie.

**Saturday, November 13, 2010: Party Time**

We arrived at the club at 4:30 on Friday; the weather was mild with a few high clouds; there was no wind. A board meeting at 5:00 meant I could give Ivy only a short walk during which I saw no ducks.

At 6:00 o’clock Harlan drove us to Rich Island for the annual marsh party. About forty-five were present, the attendance a little lower than in previous years. Our hosts served a nice selection of hot hors d’oeuvres followed by a main meal of Caesar salad, barbequed tri-tip, mashed potatoes, green beans and white cake for dessert. I left the party at 8:30 and walked the mile back to the club in the light of the setting half moon. The temperature wasn’t very cold so I dressed Ivy in her neoprene jacket and let her sleep in her kennel.

On Saturday morning the sky was clear and the wind light and variable. The forecast called for strong north winds so I went to blind \#9. I hadn’t been there in several years. I liked the layout of the pond and resolved to return when and if the new ducks arrived. Once again, the morning was extremely quiet and in contrast to Tuesday, I didn’t see many high-flying flocks. I did fire two rounds at a mallard that passed high – probably too high – overhead. I picked up at 9:15 and went in with an unused duck strap and a cartridge bag lighter by two.

We had giant hamburgers for lunch.

Other: Only four of our hunters went out. Steve Martinelli bagged a gadwall at blind \#17, Andy Stone, a sprig at \#15 and his partner Tad Bowers, two goldeneye.

**Wednesday, November 17, 2010: It Must Have Been Moonglow . . .**

. . . that enabled the ducks to feed all night and rest on Wednesday rather than fly. Marc, Jim Koeppen, Jim Graziani and I crossed the river on Tuesday afternoon at 12:30. The temperature was warm, the sky clear and the air dead calm. We made sandwiches at the club. I took a long walk with Ivy and saw only a few ducks. Marc’s afternoon was more productive; he went out to blind \#26, took advantage of his only opportunity and bagged a hen sprig.

Dinner featured a perfectly cooked turkey with all the trimmings and pumpkin pie for dessert.

On Wednesday morning the sky was clear and still calm. I had second pick and went to blind \#15. Early on, while I was watching a distant flock of ducks through my binoculars, about a dozen small ducks that looked and flew like teal raced past my blind. Forty-five minutes later a similar flock appeared and this time I was ready. I blew the teal call and as they sped by, fired a shot that brought one down in the water about 20 yards east of the blind. It tried to dive but Ivy put her head in the water and caught it. To my disappointment it turned out to be a goldeneye. All in all, the morning was the slowest of the season. I went in at 9:45.

During lunch, giant hamburgers once again, Jim Koeppen looked out the window and spotted three raccoons on Mud Slough road. Harlan went out and attended to them (his cartridges, Remington 3 ½ dram copper coated no. 4’s).

Other: Marc went back to \#26 in the morning and got a teal; Jim Koeppen bagged a mallard at \#12 which he kindly gave me. Jim Graziani got skunked at blind \#3.

**Saturday, November 20, 2010: Just Sitting in the Rain**

The spell of mild weather that had been in place broke on Friday. The temperature dropped and the sky was covered with clouds from an advancing cold front. The temperature was in the low 60’s. We crossed the river at 2:00 o’clock; shortly after we arrived at the club a light rain shower began. After it passed I took Ivy for a walk out the gate and saw a number of ducks in the air to the east, apparently disturbed by a helicopter that landed at Wheeler Island. There were also a few ducks resting in the area of \#1 pond.

Dinner commenced with Caesar salad with a main course of roast beef, red potatoes roasted with rosemary and green beans and pumpkin pie with whipped cream for dessert.

Some rain fell during the night but at 4:45, when I went out to rouse Ivy, the front had passed and the stars and moon were shining. There were some clouds in the west and a brisk wind was blowing from the south. I had a fairly low blind choice but when those ahead of me decided to stay in, I had first pick and invited Mike Corsetti to join me at blind \#12. The sunrise was as beautiful as I’ve ever seen on the marsh with the clouds painted various shades of pink and orange. However the ducks were nowhere in sight, although in response to my call a pair of spoonies made several circles over my island.

Shortly after 8:00, Mike saw an advancing rain shower, suffered an attack of prudence and went in. I decided to stay out and spent the next forty-five minutes sitting in the rain. Strange to say, I felt so peaceful and contented that I was happy to stay put. At 9:15 the rain stopped, the sky partially cleared and when there still no ducks to be seen, I picked up and went in with all my cartridges.

After disassembling and thoroughly drying my Beretta 390, I sat down to a lunch of hot open face turkey sandwiches with mashed potatoes and gravy. We left the club around noon.

Other: Jim Koeppen Jr. was high Gun with a single teal that he gave to me. I had it for dinner the following Monday.

**Wednesday, November 24, 2010: A Conversation at Blind \#15**

Saturday’s rain intensified on Sunday; the front passed through on Monday and was followed by an influx of Arctic air and strong northwest winds. Tuesday’s crossing was cold and rough. I hoped that the dramatic change in the weather would bring new ducks to the marsh but on a sunset walk with Ivy I saw only a few.

At cocktail time the temperature was dropping and frost warnings were posted so I brought Ivy in and settled her in my room. Dinner featured a perfectly cooked crown roast pork, roasted potatoes, sautéed asparagus, accompanied by delicious gravy; dessert was poached pears with ice cream.

At 5:00 o’clock the next morning, the temperature was 34 degrees and the walkways were covered with frost. The wind had moderated and shifted to the west. The sky was perfectly clear. I wasn’t particularly enthusiastic about going out but I pushed myself and went to blind \#15. I took my time getting there and wasn’t ready to shoot until just before sunrise. The change in the weather had indeed brought new ducks to the marsh, unfortunately the ones that are only edible with tartar sauce, in other words, diving ducks. The only quarry duck that came anywhere near my blind was a drake mallard that passed by at 250 yards.

On my previous hunt, I’d enjoyed being out on the marsh even in the rain and with no ducks; this day the bitter cold made it an ordeal. At 8:30 Ivy began barking insistently. I understood what she was saying: “It’s freezing cold, nothing’s flying, take me in, I want my breakfast.” [^2] I replied, “You have more sense than I do,” so I picked up and went in, once again with all my cartridges.

[^2]: I feed Ivy after the hunt so that she can better digest her food.

We had beef Stroganoff for lunch.

Other: Kurt Koeppen bagged a mallard and a widgeon at blind \#12. Everyone else got skunked. When Jim Graziani set out his motor started sputtering and he had to go back to the dock.

**Wednesday, December 1, 2010: The Wrong Kind of Duck**

I stayed home over Thanksgiving weekend and attended the Auto Show with John and grandson Peter. (My favorites were the Aston Martin and the new Rolls Royce Ghost.) Shooting at the club was fairly good.

On Tuesday afternoon we crossed the river under a clear but hazy sky; the wind was from the northeast. I took hour’s walk with Ivy and saw a number of mallards in the area of \#1 pond. Dinner was Caesar salad, a hearty stew and chocolate cake for dessert. Near freezing temperatures were predicted for the night so Ivy slept in my room.

Wednesday dawned almost dead calm, clear and hazy with a scattering of cirrus clouds. I went to blind \#1 and as I approached the island a dozen or so mallards flew up from the cover by the road, but after that, only diving ducks came anywhere near. About forty-five minutes into the hunt, a duck flew high overhead. I was measuring distances with my rangefinder and didn’t see it in time. Later another duck came over at 40 yards. This time I was ready; I pivoted and took it going away. It fell into the cover about 100 yards to the south but Ivy had marked it, went straight to it and brought it to hand. Unfortunately it turned out to be a spoonie. Except for my recognition, this shot was textbook perfect. Mike Corsetti was high Gun with a sprig, a mallard and a spoonie at blind \#12. Everyone else was skunked.

Because of the tide we had lunch at 11:00 o’clock, pastrami and melted cheese sandwiches and left around noon.

Bag: one spoonie for one cartridge.

**Saturday, December 4, 2010: A Scare and Ivy at her Best**

On Friday afternoon the cold spell had eased; the temperature was in the high 50’s, with a cover of thick clouds at 3,000 feet and a brisk wind out of the east. Winter haze cut visibility to about one mile. We crossed the river at 3:00 o’clock. I walked Ivy out about three-quarters of the way to the gate, saw no ducks on the property and after giving her an early dinner, spent the time until cocktails reading in my room.

Steve Martinelli, Corey Able and his guest Richard Carli would have envied my afternoon. Around 4:00 o’clock the three went out fishing in Corey’s boat. Three men in one of our small boats is a recipe for trouble. As they were trolling past the \#23 boat ditch, Corey hooked a fish. He stood up and the boat rocked, causing him to lose his balance and fall on Steve. Then the boat capsized tossing all three into the water. Half swimming and half wading in chin high water, they managed to reach the east shore of the slough. Steve made an arduous and very cold half-mile walk back to the club to get help during which he had to swim across three or four deep ditches. Harlan went out in the club boat and rescued the other two survivors.

Dinner was subdued. As acting president I told the group that we should consider ourselves very fortunate that the coroner and the sheriff were not at the club. I emphasized that the marsh is not necessarily a dangerous place until one takes it for granted. Our menu was a green salad with a Caesar dressing, meat loaf with mashed potatoes, peas and carrots and mushroom gravy, with a tiramisu layer cake for dessert.

Some sprinkles of rain fell during the night and at 5:00 a.m., the overcast, haze and the east wind were still in place. I had first pick and invited Jim Koeppen Jr. to join me at blind \#12; we went out in my boat and were ready shortly after shooting time. Before long Jim made a crossing shot on a mallard drake that came down sixty yards to west of Jim’s blind. Jim went out after it and I sent Ivy. She traversed about 120 yards to the bird, grabbed it as it was trying to escape into the tulles and brought it to me.

Sometime later I hit a hen widgeon that was crossing to the east of me. It sailed a distance, then came down in the pickleweed about 100 yards to the north. I saw the splash but Ivy probably didn’t because she set out in the wrong direction. I got out and headed for where it came down. Ivy joined me and after coursing back and forth several times, she picked up the scent. She went another 100 yards and amazingly, caught the running duck in the high grass near the slough. She brought it back to the island while I was making my way back there. She dropped it once but quickly recaught it and kept hold of it until I reached the blind. Later she made a routine retrieve on a teal that Jim brought down near his blind.

Otherwise the morning was extremely quiet; some spoonies circled our blinds but no other good ducks came anywhere near. We picked up at 9:15 and went in.

We had leftover beef stew with rice for lunch.

Bag: one widgeon for one cartridge.

Other: our eleven hunters bagged a total of twenty-five ducks. Erik Cushman was high Gun with four teal and a widgeon.

**Wednesday, December 8, 2010: Radio Days**

|   |

|   |

At 4:00 o’clock on Tuesday we crossed the river under a gray and hazy sky. It was almost dead calm. I spent my first half-hour at the club familiarizing myself with the pair of Cobra two-way radios that I’d bought, prompted by the past Friday’s near tragedy. It was almost dark when I walked with Ivy about a quarter of the way to the gate; I didn’t see any ducks.

We had Caesar salad, roast Cornish game hens, white and brown rice with deep fired broccoli and cordone, and chocolate pie for dessert.

The temperature was mild enough for Ivy to sleep in her kennel. Some rain fell during the night and at 5:00 o’clock, when I went out to wake her, the sky was still overcast with only the faintest movement of air from the east. As I walked back to the clubhouse I felt a few drops of rain. The rain increased during breakfast time. Marc, Richard Vaccari and Steve Martinelli went out, Jim Graziani, Mike Corsetti and Jim Koeppen stayed in. I decided to wait a while. At 7:00 I went out to blind \#1 and forty-five minutes later was ready to shoot. A few minutes later, a duck came to my decoys, wings-set and feet-down. I said to myself, “Only a spoonie would be this dumb.” As it flared off I recognized it as a drake mallard. A short time later three ducks passed overhead at thirty-five yards. I focused on one, hit it with my first shot, fired again as it was coming down and watched it fall about sixty yards south of the blind. Ivy made a straightforward retrieve. Later, as I was chatting on the radio with Jim Koeppen, a pair of mallards glided toward me. By the time I partially collected myself and fired two off-balance shots at them, they were probably out of range. I missed three other shots at passing mallards.

The rain fell all morning. I picked up at 9:45, pleased with the duck on my strap but unhappy with my overall performance. As it turned out, I was high Gun; everyone else got skunked.

We had meat loaf sandwiches for lunch.

Bag: one mallard for seven cartridges.

**Wednesday, December 15, 2010: A Compressed Hunt**

A dinner engagement kept me at home on Friday. There was a large attendance at the club but the total bag was light. Tuesday was cloudy with a southwest wind and rain forecast for the afternoon and night. Because of the tide we crossed the river at 11:30 and had a lunch of hot pastrami and melted cheese sandwiches at the club. There were only five hunters, Mike Corsetti, Jim Graziani, Jim Koeppen, Marc Pasquini and I. At 2:30 I took Ivy for a short walk. There were ducks on the house pond. Any thoughts about going out for an afternoon hunt were set aside when rain showers approached from the west.

Dinner was outstanding: baked short ribs with gravy, mashed potatoes, sautéed Swiss chard and a delightful chocolate cake covered with strawberries for dessert.

It wasn’t terribly cold but because of the rain and a strong south wind blowing directly into the kennels, Ivy slept in my room. By morning the rain had passed, there was a scattering of high clouds and a fairly brisk wind from the southwest.

I had second pick and went to blind \#26, set fourteen decoys in the little bays around the island and was ready about 7:00 o’clock. Hardly anything was flying. However, shortly after sunrise I spied a pair of gadwall flying over the far side of the pond and blew my widgeon call. They made a wide circle around the north shore and then came my way from the west. As the drake was about to pass directly overhead, I pointed my gun behind the bird, swung through, pressed the trigger and hit it solidly. It fell no more than 20 feet from the island, giving Ivy her easiest retrieve of the season, and making me high Gun for the day. Everyone else drew a blank.

Harlan went out a little after 8:00 and scared up some mallards from \#23 pond. I fired three ineffective rounds at two of them as they passed by at extreme range.

We all went in early, ate a hurried lunch of roast beef sandwiches and pulled away from the club dock at 11:30 in order to catch the tide.

Bag: one gadwall for four cartridges

**Saturday, December 18, 2010: More Enjoyable than Expected**

Another vigorous storm was headed our way on Friday afternoon and when I left home I wasn’t looking forward to the outing. Rain usually chases the ducks off the marsh and were it not for a Board meeting at the Club, I probably would have stayed home. At McAvoy, the weather was just plain miserable, with fog, light rain, 45 degree temperature and a strong southeast wind that made it feel much colder. When we reached the club after a rough crossing, I dressed Ivy in her neoprene jacket, took her for a short walk during a break in the rain showers and saw a few mallards in the area of \#1 pond.

The Board meeting concluded just in time for a quick cocktail before dinner. The meal was one the season’s best, featuring crown roast of pork, sautéed spinach, rice and tiramisu cake for dessert. Afterward I brought Ivy inside, gave her a goodnight cookie and settled down for the night.

A warm front passed through during the night; at 5:00 a.m. the rain had stopped and the temperature was at least 10 degrees warmer. The sky was covered with clouds of various shapes and shades of gray with the cloud base reflecting the lights of Sacramento. I went to blind \#3 and spent the next two hours enjoying the cloudscape and the scenery. The few ducks I saw were well out of range, except for a spoonie that came over my decoys. I let it go. At 9:00 o’clock, the sight of an approaching rain squall prompted me to pick up and go in, my cartridge bag full and gun unfired.

We had lasagna for lunch.

Other: Kurt and Jim Koeppen Jr. bagged 10 good ducks at blind 12; the shooters in blinds \#8 and \#10 also enjoyed some success. Mike Corsetti went to blind \#1 but didn’t fire a shot.

**Wednesday, December 22, 2010: The Dead of Winter**

Attendance at this hunt was very light: Marc and I plus Steve Martinelli, Richard Vaccari and Jim Koeppen. We crossed the river at 3:00 o’clock under an overcast sky with a brisk east wind. The temperature was in the low 50’s and the forecast called for rain. We saw about a dozen mallards on the house pond plus some spoonies but when Ivy and I walked out to just short of the gate, we didn’t see any other ducks.

Because of the low number at the club, Abe the cook was given the time off and Harlan prepared the dinner: green salad, New York steaks, baked potatoes, asparagus and apple pie for dessert. Marc contributed a bottle of cabernet sauvignon that went well with the meal.

At 5:00 a.m., there was a break in the rain and the wind had shifted to the southeast. During breakfast the rain returned. At Jim Koeppen’s suggestion I picked blind \#8 but waited to go out until it was light and the rain had stopped.

The morning was dreary; the sky was overcast with high fog while a winter haze obscured the scenery. The only semblance of excitement came when three pintail circled my blind at 250 yards before flying on. And there was very little of the usual bird life; I observed only a few hawks, seagulls and diving ducks. However, a large flock of geese came over well out of range before landing in the area of blind \#23. I picked up at 9:15 without having fired a shot.

For lunch we had spaghetti with an excellent mushroom sauce.

Other: Steve Martinelli had originally been unsure whether he would come to this hunt but agreed to do so upon learning that he was the only qualified boat operator, his reward, a pair of mallards taken at blind \#12 (plus a spoonie). Richard Vaccari also bagged a spoonie at \#12. Marc got skunked and Jim Koeppen didn’t go out.

**Tuesday and Wednesday, December 29 – 30, 2010: Score Four for the Raccoon**

We crossed the river at 11:30 on Tuesday under a gray sky with a light east wind. The temperature was in the low 50’s and a few drops of rain were falling. A powerful storm with strong winds and heavy rains was expected to arrive that evening and continue into Wednesday morning. After a lunch of sandwiches we decided to hunt in the afternoon because we might not be able to go out in the morning.

I went to blind \#1, arriving there shortly after 3:00 o’clock, and spent the next hour and a half staring into an empty sky as the rain continued to fall, the time bearable because the wind was so light. A pair of mallards that settled down in the boat ditch about 65 yards from the blind provided the afternoon’s only excitement. I picked up at 4:25, went in, disassembled my gun and dried its parts.

Harlan prepared our dinner: roast loin of pork, roast potatoes, asparagus and scarlet mousse cake for dessert. Afterward, expecting harsh weather, I brought Ivy inside.

The wind and rain rattled my window during the night but by 5:00 a.m. the front had passed and the wind, still very strong, had shifted to the southwest. Jim Graziani invited me to join me at blind \#26. The two of us went out in my boat; the extra weight made it more controllable in the wind.

I had just gotten into the blind after hiding my boat when Jim raised his gun and connected with a drake widgeon that was directly overhead. The wind carried it about 15 yards out on the pond but Ivy easily retrieved it. This was Jim’s first good duck of the season. During the morning I saw more ducks that I’d seen since opening day. The problem was that in the brilliant sunshine they could also see us. A flock of mallards flew by on my side. Jim said they were in range but the glare from the sun prevented me from seeing them in time.

Because of the tide we had to make an early departure so we picked up at 9:00 o’clock. On Tuesday afternoon Steve Martinelli bagged a mallard that he put it in the refrigerator in the plucking shed. During the night a raccoon opened the door and stole it.

Jim Koeppen also had some good luck that turned bad. He went to blind \#3 and bagged two mallards and a spoonie. When he came in he put them on the table in the plucking shed and then left for a few minutes. During that time a raccoon stole the ducks and, adding insult to injury, left the spoonie’s head on the clubhouse stairs.

We had spaghetti for lunch and left the club a little after 12:00.

Other: Rich Vaccari’s three gadwall at blind \#12 made him high Gun.

**Wednesday January 5, 2011: The Punishment for Pessimism**

When we crossed the river on Tuesday afternoon the temperature hovered around 50 degrees but the east wind made it feel much colder. The dozen or so widgeon on the house pond confirmed Harlan’s report of ducks on the property and when Ivy and I took a sunset walk, I saw a few more. It felt too cold to go the half mile out to the gate so we turned around 100 yards beyond the curve in the road.

Abe our chef was back and dinner featured roast leg of lamb, mashed potatoes with gravy, sautéed asparagus and chocolate cake for dessert. Freezing temperatures were expected so Ivy slept in my room.

At 3:00 a.m. a dense fog covered the club but it was gone at 5:00 a.m. and the sky was clear. I’d experienced many days on the marsh that were clear at first light but had seen dense fog form at sunrise. I expected this to happen and picked blind \#3 to assure myself a short and easy return to the clubhouse when the fog settled in.

When I went out there were banks of dense fog on the river and to the east, but they never reached the club. The sky remained clear. It was also clear of ducks at my blind. I did fire my gun this time, two ineffective shots at a widgeon. I watched a large flock of geese land at Rich Island on the other side of the road.

At 9:00 o’clock I picked up and went in. When the others came in, I realized my mistake. Richard Vaccari had gone out early to blind \#26 and was ready at shooting time. By sunrise he had a limit, 4 widgeon, two pintail and a teal. Jim Graziani and Frank Fiala went to blind \#12. Jim doubled on mallards and Frank bagged two pintail, two widgeon a mallard and a teal. They told me I should have gone to blind \#15 because the northeast wind would have been ideal and they’d seen many ducks going into that pond. Marc Pasquini got skunked at blind \#8.

We had chicken pot pie for lunch and made a leisurely departure at 2:00 o’clock.

**Saturday, January 8, 2011: Ivy’s Recalcitrance**

We crossed the river at 4:00 o’clock under a high fog. The near 40 degree temperature felt so cold that when we arrived I put on several layers of warm clothing and dressed Ivy in her neoprene jacket. Fortunately the air was calm; any wind would have made it feel even colder. I walked with Ivy about three-quarters of the way to the gate and saw a few ducks in the area of \#1 pond.

There were fourteen hunters at the club; dinner featured a New York strip roast barbecued in the Chinese smoker, mashed potatoes with gravy, steamed broccoli and cheesecake for dessert. I brought Ivy inside immediately after dinner.

The high fog in the morning combined with a 5 mph. wind from the northwest prompted me to pick blind \#15. I invited Jim Koeppen, Jr. to join me. He went out first and when I arrived to find the pond had been admirably decoyed. Shortly after shooting young Jim performed another admirable feat, a stylish overhead double on a pair of mallards. The drake fell right by the island and was still very lively; Ivy was so eager to go after it that I had trouble releasing her from her tether and by the time she was free, the duck had nearly reached the tulles 70 yards behind the blind. She followed it into the tulles, caught the still lively duck and brought it to hand. Meanwhile, Jim picked up the hen which had fallen in shallow water.

We saw quite a few ducks but they didn’t want to come to the decoys. Our other hunters had the same experience. I missed two shots at teal. Later, two mallards passed within range. When I stood up to shoot, my knee buckled. I recovered my balance and managed to fire one shot but by this time they were out of range.

At 9:20 I decided to go in. Usually, at the end of a hunt Ivy is eager to jump into the boat and head back for her breakfast. This day she refused; she wanted to stay out and keep hunting with Jim. I finally had to force her into the boat.

We had spaghetti with meat sauce for lunch.

Bag: skunked for three cartridges.

Other: our hunters bagged fifteen ducks and a goose.

**Wednesday, January 12, 2011: The Best Laid Plans . . .**

An unusual tide on Tuesday required that we cross the river at 11:00 o’clock. The sky was overcast with high clouds with the wind from the east. Winter haze cut visibility to three miles but the air didn’t feel as cold as it had on Saturday. At the club there were quite a few ducks on the house pond and I saw more on a walk with Ivy out to the gate. In the afternoon Les and Richard Vaccari went out to blind \#26 and returned with a mallard. The next morning then went back and Rich bagged a pintail and a widgeon. Rain began falling at 5:00 o’clock

Dinner commenced with freshly cooked prawns to compliment the salad. The main course was leftover roast beef, mashed potatoes with gravy and sautéed chard. The dessert was banana rum ice cream. Because of the cold I brought Ivy inside.

Wednesday dawned with high cloud cover which broke up during the morning. The wind was from the north at 5-10 mph. I had first pick and went to blind \#15 while Jim Graziani went to blind \#12. We planned to cover both ends of the pond and “bounce” the ducks between us. But it was not to be. Very little was flying. A flock of sprig circled my blind at 60 yards and later a pair of mallards did likewise. I held fire but later wasted a round at some ducks that were even higher overhead. Jim Graziani, who was in blind \#12, didn’t fire a shot all morning. Marc Pasquini brought down a spoonie at blind \#10.

We had lasagna for lunch and left from Wheeler Island, where Harlan had moved the boat to escape a very low tide at our dock that would have stranded us at the club until after sunset.

Bag: skunked for one round fired.

**Saturday, January 15, 2011: Adventures in the Fog**

Friday was as fine a January day as could be wished for, the temperature a mild 60 or so degrees, a gentle west wind and the blue sky decorated with cirrus clouds. Horizontal visibility was excellent. Our noon crossing made enabled me to walk a mile or so with Ivy on Division Line Road all the way out to the new resting pond where I saw hundreds of ducks. Our presence didn’t much bother them; those closest to the road got up, flew a hundred yards or so and then settled back down.

We enjoyed a turkey dinner with all the trimmings, dressing, baked sweet potatoes, peas and strawberry cheesecake for dessert. The temperature was not excessively cold so I dressed Ivy in her neoprene jacket and let her sleep outside.

At 3:00 a.m. a ground fog was beginning to form and by breakfast time it had become so dense that visibility was reduced to 150 yards. The wind, still fairly light, was out of the northeast. I waited in the clubhouse until 7:00 o’clock and then went out to blind \#1. I put out only seven decoys and at 7:45 was ready to shoot. It wasn’t long before a flock of large ducks materialized overhead but they vanished into the fog before I could react. Around 8:15 four teal came to my call; I focused on one, fired, missed, but connected with my second shot as it was climbing away. If fell in the pond about 25 yards from the blind and disappeared underwater. I thought we’d lost it but in a few seconds it floated to the surface, an easy retrieve for Ivy.

Later I missed two shots at teal that I’d called in and two more at a pair of mallards at 45 yards range. We’d scheduled an early departure because of the tide so I was back at the clubhouse at 9:45, not particularly pleased with my shooting yet happy to have bagged a duck despite the fog. After a hurried lunch of grilled pastrami and cheese sandwiches we pulled away from the dock shortly after noon.

The fog was even worse on the river. With visibility down to no more than 50 yards we crossed the river at reduced speed sounding the horn and with all eyes peeled for other traffic. Frank Fiala was at the helm. Navigating by dead reckoning based on the times, speed and compass headings that Jim Graziani had calculated at an earlier date, he brought us directly to the mouth of McAvoy Harbor.

Bag: one teal for six cartridges.

Other: Ryan Murphy and his guest bagged five ducks at blind \#17; Jim Graziani made a 70 yard shot on a bufflehead.

**Wednesday, January 19, 2011: Ambushed by the Fog**

On Tuesday afternoon Ivy and I rode to McAvoy with Marc and his quest Paul Holland for a 3:30 crossing. Frank Fiala, Steve Martinelli and Richard Vaccari filled out the party. The weather was unusually fine for January with a clear sky, mild temperature and a fresh west wind. Horizontal visibility was excellent. Frank accompanied Ivy and me on a walk out to the gate. We saw some mallards near the junction with Division Line Road.

Abe the chef was away for jury duty but Harlan with assists from Frank, Marc and Paul, presented an outstanding chippino dinner, one of the best in recent memory. And Paul contributed a magnum of champagne that enhanced the pleasure of the feast.

The evening was not particularly cold so Ivy, dressed in her neoprene jacket, slept in her kennel. At 5:00 a.m., when I went out to rouse her, the air was perfectly clear and the wind was blowing even more briskly out of the west. It also felt so dry that at breakfast I confidently announced to the group at that there would be no fog.

But the marsh had a nasty surprise in store. As I was pulling away from the dock to go to blind \#15, the wind shifted to the north. When I arrived at the pond around two dozen ducks got up. As I was settling into the blind, I saw a bank of fog being blown our way from the north and within twenty minutes it covered the club. Unlike Saturday, horizontal visibility remained fairly good, never less than 200 yards and gradually extending to over a mile. But the ceiling was never higher than 100 feet. Early on a flock of what looked like big ducks materialized out of the mist, circled and came to my whistle. I picked out one, fired two shots and brought it down in the pond about 35 yards to the west. Ivy easily retrieved it. I thought it was a drake widgeon but it turned out to be the largest goldeneye I’ve ever seen. Later I missed two makeable shots at mallards.

Frank was shooting in blind \#12, 400 yards to the south of me. He said he had pintail over him all morning and was frustrated because he had to stop at two. He also bagged a teal. Meanwhile, Marc and his guest were having a grand time at blind \#8, bagging five teal and a Canada goose. It was Marc’s best shoot of the season.

Happily the tide was no problem this day and after a leisurely lunch of tri-tip sandwiches, we departed the club at 2:00 o’clock.

Bag: one goldeneye for four cartridges.

Other: Steve Martinelli and Richard Vaccari each caught two beautiful striped bass

**Wednesday, January 26, 2011: And Still More Fog**

An event kept me home on Saturday while at the club fifteen hunters bagged twenty-four ducks. On Tuesday afternoon we crossed the river at 4:00 o’clock under a clear but hazy sky with the temperature cool and a moderate wind out of the east. On our walk out to gate and saw 15 or so ducks get up from the pond next to the junction with Division Road.

For dinner we had the chippino that was left over from the previous Tuesday. The air turned cold and Ivy slept inside.

A dense fog formed at midnight and when I went out visibility was no more than 100 yards. I picked blind \#1 but waited until 7:00 o’clock to go out. Quite a few big ducks got up when I entered the pond. Around 7:45, when I had set my decoys, hidden the boat and was in the barrel ready to shoot, I could see some of the power poles on the road; this indicated that horizontal visibility had extended to about 300 yards, but the ceiling remained very low. I had two chances at large ducks, fired two rounds each time and missed. It’s hard to estimate range and lead in the fog.

We had oyster and bacon omelets for lunch. We left from Wheeler Island in Tim Murphy’s boat; he had moved it there in the morning because the low tide.

Richard Vaccari was high Gun with six good ducks at \#26.

**Saturday, January 29, 2011: Humiliation with a Sugar Coating**

My final hunt of the season illustrated the adage that sometimes it’s better to be lucky than good. On Friday we crossed the river at noon to catch the tide. The weather was mild in San Francisco but the club was covered with fog that a cold east wind had blown in from the Valley. I took Ivy for a walk to the gate and saw about two dozen mallards in the area around blind \#1. At dinner time the fog was extremely dense with visibility less than 100 yards.

Dinner was a special treat: Caesar salad, buffalo shanks cooked *osso bucco* style with a superb gravy, mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli and bananas Foster for dessert. I brought Ivy inside and just for fun, posted a “Beware of Dog” sign on my door. She slept undisturbed.

At breakfast time a 5-8 mph. southwest wind had blown away the ground fog; horizontal visibility was excellent although there remained a cover of high fog at an estimated 1,500 feet. I decided to end the season where I had started it, at blind \#1. I set out a dozen decoys and shortly after shooting time was in the barrel and ready for action. But for the first hour, there wasn’t any.

I knew from our afternoon walks that there had to be some ducks in the area and so shortly 8:00 o’clock I loaded an old cartridge and, borrowing a trick from John Batley, fired a “scare shot.” At least fifty ducks got up from the area between the blind and the road; I was surprised there were so many. Some of them headed my way so I stood up and fired at the leader. It kept flying but the duck that was following it tumbled into the pond and lay still on the water, about 40 yards out from the blind. Any embarrassment about my appalling aim was eclipsed by the joyous sight of Ivy swimming back to the island bearing a large drake mallard.  Later I missed two shots at a mallard high overhead. At 9:15 I picked up for the last time and went in reasonably contented with the duck on my strap.

We had a hurried lunch of lasagna and pulled away from the dock at noon.

**Postseason Reflections**

While hardly a great season, my seven mallards, two widgeon, one gadwall and one teal (plus regrettably, two spoonies and two diving ducks) doubled last year’s take. I fired fifty-eight cartridges (not counting disabling shots) for a 3.87 per-bird average. As always happens, my shooting skills deteriorated during the season, most likely because of the very few shooting opportunities that were presented. One of the benefits of clay target shooting is that when you miss, you can identify your mistake, correct it on the next shot, and reinforce the proper technique on subsequent shots. In duck hunting, no two shots are alike and they come infrequently. So be it, I have the long off-season to recover my form.

Regarding Ivy, my preseason concerns proved groundless. She performed brilliantly, bringing back every duck for which she was sent. My only lost duck was the mallard that sailed too for me to send her on my second hunt. However, as the season drew to a close, I became increasingly aware that she was getting tired. Setting out from home for the season’s final hunt, she had to be coaxed to get into the Land Rover. At the club, however, she remained as enthusiastic as ever. Accordingly, the search for a worth understudy now commences.

May you all enjoy the off-season.
