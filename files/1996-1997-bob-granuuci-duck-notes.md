**1996-97 Duck Season Journal**

by Bob Granucci

This year, I resolved, was going to be different. As the summer months rolled by, I recalled last season's grandiose expectations and mediocre results and promised myself not to get overexcited about the approaching duck season. On August 8th, I took Muriel, John, Paula and our grandchildren to the club. In the dry hot wind and haze of late summer, the marsh can be bleaker than during winter's gloomy days. We walked out on \#21 pond to the box blind and saw quite a few pheasants and a few mallards in the area. Other members said they'd been seeing many ducks, in fact there had been a double hatch. I tried not to think about it.

I went back to the club for a work party on September 7th, taking the boat with Jim Graziani, Les Vacari, Michael St.Peter and his son Mitch. The other members drove in through Fairfield and reported seeing many pheasants alongside the road. We spent the day out in the fields dressing the blinds with a new type of cover, marsh grass woven into wood and wire frames, which looked much more realistic than the bundles of tulles we'd been using. I saw a few ducks in the air, nothing close. The ponds were bone dry and it was very hot, at least 95 degrees. Mike Corsetti and Chuck Yirchott told us that while they were sitting on the porch the previous evening enjoying the sunset, they were astonished to see a flock of fifty pelicans land nearby. Two weeks later, I went back to the club for another work party and helped Jim Graziani and Rich Vacari paint the lanai, and still tried not to think about the ducks.

Saturday, October 20th: A Grand Opening.

The drive to the club felt different this year but the old excitement was still there. In contrast to the languid autumn days of recent years, the weather was fairly brisk thanks to a cold front that passed through Northern California on Friday bringing light rain and fresh winds. I took the noon boat and made a choppy crossing under an overcast sky.

Most of the afternoon was spent getting my room and boat ready. Meanwhile Daisy was lodged in the kennel. At 4:00 o'clock, her normal feeding time, she began barking insistently. One wag commented, "It's Rocky II."[^1]

[^1]: Referring, of course, to the episode of Rocky, the dog that barked all night. (See, 1995-96 Duck Season Journal, p. 11.)

My preparations completed and Daisy fed, we accompanied Jim Graziani and Bandit on a stroll out Division Road to the near end of \#4 pond. The front had passed and except for a few trailing clouds, the late afternoon sky was clear. We didn't see many ducks and were concerned that the rain had chased them away from the marsh.

Dinner was splendid: Caesar salad, prime rib accompanied by perfectly poached asparagus, baked potatoes, the desert a home made cheesecake topped with strawberries. Our wine, a 1993 Caberbnet from Oak Vineyards, proved remarkable mature and smooth despite its relative youth. We all left the table in high spirits, one of us so spirited that at 12:47 a.m. he marched up and down the corridors blowing his duck call.

Our apprehension about the morning proved groundless. Saturday turned out to be the best opener in years. The partly cloudy sky, crystal clear visibility and fresh southwest wind made it delightful simply to be out on the marsh. The shooting matched the weather. Nearly everyone bagged mallards and sprig; several members limited. I went to blind \#4, shot well but not as selectively as I would have wished and brought in a pair of widgeon, a pair of teal, a gadwall and alas, a pair of spoonies for nine rounds fired. I used Holland & Holland 2 and 1/2 inch paper cartridges loaded with 1 and 1/16th ounces of no. 6 bismuth; they cycled perfectly in the Beretta 390 and proved very effective, even at fairly long range. Several other shooters also used bismuth loads with excellent results, the consensus being that the performance of this ammunition fully justifies the extra cost.

Throughout the morning I enjoyed watching all the ducks in the air. The most spectacular moment was when a flock of thirty Canada geese flew directly over Jim Koeppen at blind \#7 at 15 feet altitude, then continued down the pond, passing my blind about 50 yards out. I let them pass, telling myself, "There must be a reason why Jim didn't shoot." There was; goose season was still two weeks away.

A lunch of pasta with Italian sausage in a rich tomato and sweet bell pepper sauce concluded the happy morning.

Bag: 2 widgeon, 2 teal, 2 spoonies, 1 gadwall. Shots fired - 9; ratio = 1.285 shots per duck taken[^2]

[^2]: With this qualification: I did not shoot one of the widgeon. Daisy found the crippled but still lively bird while she was hunting for one of my teal which had swum across the pond to blind \#5.

Other: I went home on Saturday afternoon. Most of our shooters stayed over and dined on barbecued duck. The shooting on Sunday morning was generally poor but Jim Graziani and Les Vacari shot together and brought in six big ducks.

Buzzy Theibaut, our senior member, had not been shooting ducks for several years but he returned to the marsh in grand style, downing a pair of mallard drakes with his very first shot. It can't be done any better.

Wednesday, October 23rd: Early season slowdown.

Tuesday afternoon was warm and windless, like one of Nat Cole's "Lazy, Hazy Days of Summer." The mosquitoes were out in force as Daisy and I walked out on the east side to the edge of \#21 pond. We saw only a few ducks; they were traversing a flight line between \#26-28 ponds and \#8-10 ponds. The early season doldrums had returned to the marsh.

After a dinner featuring roast pork and cauliflower mashed potatoes, I took Daisy for a short walk before settling her down. By now the sky was overcast with a fresh wind from the west.

I had a low draw and went back to blind \#4. There was high fog in the 180 - 270 degree quadrant and although it was dead calm at shooting time, a wind soon arose from the southwest. Shortly after shooting time, a duck approached the island. I brought it down with one shot and, after Daisy brought it in, saw to my distress that it was a spoonie. Will I ever learn to be extremely careful about shooting in dim light? I redeemed myself later by bringing down a mallard at 45 yards range. I fired two shots at it and at first thought I had missed. It flew another 150 yards, then dropped stone dead by the far edge of the pond. I took Daisy over and when she saw it, she brought it to hand. Otherwise, the morning was unexciting; there were only a few ducks flying. I concluded the session by wasting a shot a duck that was probably too high.

Bag: 1 mallard and 1 spoonie. Shots fired - 4; ratio = 2.00 shots per duck taken.

Other: Shooting was mediocre to poor throughout the club. Most of the ducks seen were spoonies and a number were brought in.

Saturday, October 26th: The big wind.

In happy contrast to last autumn's parade of dry warm days, we enjoyed several weather changes during the first week of the season. As Daisy and I left home on Friday afternoon, a weak storm front was passing through; when we arrived at Bay Point, the sky was partly cloudy and a strong wind was blowing out of the northwest.

I'd been invited to dinner at Sprig Farm. Because of the wind, Tim Murphy drove me there on our ATV. The ride up the east side road was exciting (bordering on scary). When I arrived at Sprig Farm, it felt like old times. I enjoyed cocktails and dinner with Alan White, Dean, Fred Ellers, Tom Lucas, Tom's son and his guest, and, as a nice surprise, Rusty Campbell. The time passed all to quickly as we reminisced about our days together at the old club. We drank the first toast at dinner to Joe Ford, Sprig Farm's beloved caretaker who died in 1994. The evening brought back a flood of memories and it was very special. By 8 o'clock the wind had diminished so Dean took me back to St. Germain by boat. Our journey down Noyce Slough under the brilliant full moon was especially scenic, the lights of the surrounding cities like a diamond necklace around the marsh.

During the night the north wind intensified and it was very strong in the morning. Chris Charles invited me to hunt with him in \#15; the boat trip out to the blind was an adventure. During the first two hours there were plenty of ducks in the clear sunlight sky but with the exception of the spoonies, they stayed well away from our blind. Chris did manage to shoot a teal but the waves in the pond were so high that Daisy couldn't see it and Chris had to retrieve it personally.

My performance was abysmal. Most duck hunters live for a strong north wind. I don't. I've never shot well in a north wind and Saturday proved true to form. I fired twelve cartridges without result, except for crippling a duck which flew over to the shore near \#13 blind. I took Daisy over and hunted it without success. I can't blame Daisy, the strong wind dissipated the scent and made tracking impossible.

I was not in the cheeriest of moods when I returned to the clubhouse but a lunch of pasta with pesto sauce (made with lots

of garlic) redeemed the morning.

Bag: Skunked. Shots fired 12.

Other: Larry Godwin bagged a mallard, a teal and three widgeon at \#13 . Most of our other shooters brought in some good ducks. Frank Fiala and Chuck Yirchott brought in a pair of red heads. Several members decided to take advantage of the wind and stay overnight.

Wednesday, October 30th: Return to Yesteryear.

On Tuesday, the strong winds which accompanied a fast moving storm knocked out the PG&E power to our sector of the marsh. We had to use the auxiliary generator, electricity was strictly rationed and there was almost no running water. As dusk, while lighting the oil lamp that Greg Stout had given me, I imagined I was in a duck club of one hundred years ago. Even Daisy was affected; she had to drink Schweppes Club Soda. Our cook failed to appear but Jim Graziani and Chris Charles cooked a satisfying dinner of broiled chicken, pasta with a rich tomato sauce, swiss chard, desert consisting of pecan pie and ice cream. Bill Harding was my guest and as usual, his flying stories made for very interesting table conversation.

I had first choice and took Bill to \#12, stationing him at the inner blind while I took the outer blind we call "the point." Wednesday's weather was exhilarating, with a 10-15 mph north wind and the sky filled with clouds of all varieties. One moment in the morning was especially dramatic. Against a backdrop of very dark clouds over the western hills our pond was bathed in sunshine that seemed like stage lighting. And a rainbow added its subtle colors to the scene. This was one of the most beautiful mornings I've ever experienced on the marsh.

However, the shooting was only fair. I brought down a sprig with two shots; Daisy made a routine retrieve. There were plenty of ducks over my blind all morning; the trouble was that they were all spoonies (except for a pair of big ducks which I let pass fearing they might be spoonies). I did have fun calling in the spoonies and going through the firing drill but was blindsided by a flock of 10-15 sprig with passed overhead about 20 yards high. In any event, Bill and I enjoyed our morning at \#12; the scenery made up for the limited shooting opportunities.

Bag: 1 sprig. Shots fired -- 3: ratio = 3.00.

Other: A number of spoonies were brought in. Jim Graziani and Mike Corsetti had a good shoot. Albert Bertucci gave Bill Harding a sprig so Bill went home with two prime ducks.

Wednesday, November 6th: The Morning After (the election, that is).

This hunt was not unlike the election returns, disappointing but far from a total disaster. Tuesday's weather was clear with a fresh west wind. Daisy and I walked out the west side road to the near end of \#4 pond. We saw a fair number of ducks in the air and felt much more encouraged than last November.

Our dinner was as enjoyable as usual; it featured veal picatta and for desert, a white cake covered with warm banana and walnut sauce.

Rich Vacari invited me to shoot with me and we went out to \#7 pond in my boat. Proceeding down the ditch to the blind under the waning moon's faint light, we saw dozens of ducks getting up. The morning was an aesthetic success but not a gunning one. I fired four cartridges with zero results and was twice blindsided by large flocks of ducks. However, a marvelous sight redeemed the morning. Shortly before 8:00 o'clock, the sky suddenly filled with ducks -- more than I'd ever seen at one time. They were at middle and high altitude but this didn't matter. I was so enthralled by the spectacle that I didn't care about shooting. During the morning I also saw large flocks of geese and, for the first time in several seasons, observed "clouds" of blackbirds flying over the marsh.

Rich had a most unusual mixed bag, one mallard and one skunk. I suggested he put them on each end of his strap and bring them in draped around his shoulders. Rich felt he didn't want to make that strong an impression.

Our return crossing on Wednesday afternoon was smooth and particularly pretty. My day once again confirmed that duck hunting is about much more than numbers.

Bag: Skunked. Shots fired - 4.

Other: A total of 29 ducks were taken of which 15 were mallards. Chuck Yirchott was the morning's MVP. He went to \#11 and finding the barrel full of water, he decided to sit in the grass. From the sitting position he bagged four mallard drakes with eight shots.

Wednesday, November 13th: Beating the Skunk.

I stayed home on Saturday the 9th but apparently didn't miss much, the day's most notable event being Al Bertucci's limit of spoonies at \#12.

Tuesday's boat left 15 minutes late; Jim Graziani was delayed picking up Mark Vogel, our new chef. We crossed under a hazy, windless sky. Daisy and I cut short our walk out on the west side; we saw very few ducks and turned back opposite \#3 pond.

Dinner was forty-five minutes late but well worth the wait. Mark served a beautifully roasted turkey with a dressing made of cornbread, sausage and pecans. It was very rich but so tasty I had a second helping. The meal was very well received; some said it was the best dinner of the season, so far.

Wednesday morning dawned clear, with a fresh wind out of the southwest. I had last pick and went to \#4 pond. I took my time setting the decoys and wasn't ready until 20 minutes after shooting time. No matter, the action was very slow. Except for the spoonies which came to the decoys, there were very few ducks flying. Nonetheless it was pleasant to be out in the marsh. Early in the morning the hills west of \#680 were covered with fog. Around 7:30 the fog drifted up the river and over the marsh. It was a thin fog; horizontal visibility was never less than 1/2 mile. After forty-five minutes the fog burned off. I called in a flock of teal, hit one with my first shot and missed a shot at a second bird. Later on I called in a flock of widgeon but someone fired and scared them off before they got in range. As I was picking up my decoys, I heard a "quack, quack, quack." I looked up and saw a mallard circling about 65 yards overhead. It was probably taunting me, "trash talking" if you please.

Bag: 1 teal. Shots fired = 3; ratio: 3.00.

Other: Shooting was spotty throughout the club. Frank Fiala and Chuck Yirchott went to \#12 and had sprig over their blind all morning. Jim Graziani and Mike Corsetti got skunked at \#21; ditto for Jim Koeppen at \#23.

Saturday, November 16th: Magic in the Morning.

I drove to the dock on Friday afternoon looking forward to an enjoyable time. A 2:00 o'clock boat meant that Daisy and I would be able to take a long walk; Wheeler Island was hosting the annual Marsh Party and better yet, a strong weather system was approaching the Bay Area. According to the forecast, Saturday morning would bring a gradually lowering sky and strong winds from the south in advance of the rain, ideal shooting conditions on our marsh. My anticipation grew even keener as Daisy and I walked out the Division Road to \#8 pond. We saw a fair number of ducks on the west side and as we were returning to the clubhouse, approximately 200 ducks got up from our \#23 and \#21 ponds, and then settled back down. Even so, I never imagined I was in for the hunt of a lifetime.

After topping off the gas tank in my boat, I joined the group as we hopped in the back of the pickup and bounced down the levee to Wheeler Island. As usual, the Marsh Party was an evening of fine food and camaraderie to match. I stayed until 8:30 and then walked back along the moonlit levee with Jim Koeppen, Les Vacari and Larry Godwin. However, there was one sour note. I was planning to hunt with Mike Corsetti and he mentioned that the gas I'd put in my tank contained far too much lubricant. Mike said, "You'd better not use your boat; let's go out in mine." I said, "Fine. I have second pick; you select the blind."

Mike picked \#21, a brilliant choice. Saturday morning could qualify for an episode of "The American Sportsman." A spectacular sunrise was shortly followed by an even more spectacular flight of ducks. In my fifteen years of hunting the marsh, I've never seen more ducks in the air and they just kept coming in to our pond all morning. Steve Lyon, who was hunting in \#26, described it as a "tornado of sprig" over our pond. Mike and I quickly shot our limit of sprig and then all we could do is sit awestruck as flight after flight of pintail passed over our blind well in range. I shot competently and had my limit by 9:30; Mike shot to his usual high standard and bagged two sprig, a mallard, a widgeon and a teal for ten rounds expended. Daisy "worked like a dog" and retrieved a total of twelve ducks. It's hard to imagine a better morning that the one Mike and I shared. And yet, given the superb conditions and the level of our shooting, we took only one mallard. This suggests that the local birds are becoming extremely wary. Once again I saw clouds of blackbirds making their way over the marsh.

Bag: 3 teal, 3 widgeon, 1 sprig. Shots fired - 17; ratio = 2.43.

Other: Except for our blind, shooting was fair to poor over the club. Mike Murrisson went to \#4 and didn't even fire a shot. Gary Cushman and Tim Murphy had a good shot at \#12 and Les Vacari, who shot with Al Martinelli at \#15, got some good birds. Larry Godwin got a mallard at \#9 and Chuck Yirchott went to \#8 and said the pond around the big island was so overgrown as to be unshootable.

Saturday, November 23rd: Hail to Thee Oh Alma Mater.

During the week, a series of warm Pacific storms brought rain to the Bay Area. A meeting at USF kept me in town on Wednesday. Frank said that day's shooting at the club was good for November; each of the seven hunters had brought in one or two good birds. On Friday afternoon we made a rough crossing under grey skies. It took some time to change the gas in my boat so Daisy and I were able to take only a short walk and by then it was too dark to see any ducks.

Friday's dinner featured Caesar salad, roast beef and Yorkshire pudding. These were excellent but Mark astonished everyone with his hos douvres, sauted breasts of spoonie, goldeneye and bufflehead which had been marinated in blueberries and port wine. They were delicious.

I had a fairly high choice and decided to try something different; I went to \#8A, the entrance blind at that pond. The morning was very quiet. The sky was overcast and there was only a slight breeze from the southwest. As I familiarized myself with this part of the pond and tried several decoy placements, I concluded that this blind would be well worth trying in a north wind. Once again I started by mistakenly shooting a spoonie and then settled down to a very quiet morning; the action in the area was minimal. About 9:00 I called in a flock of teal but needed three shots to bring down only one bird. It flew a distance and I had to take Daisy to help her find it. About 9:30 a big mallard flew over Sprig Farm's blind \#3 and drew fire. The bird continued and then dropped at the edge of my pond. I took Daisy out and she quickly found it. I happily put the bird on my strap; considering it a belated graduation present from my duck hunting alma mater.

Bag: 1 teal, 1 mallard, 1 spoonie. Shots fired - 4; ratio = 1.33.

Other. Jim Koeppen and his guest didn't fire a shot at \#21 while next door at \#23, Jim Graziani and Mike Corsetti got seven good ducks. Al Martinelli and his guest had a quiet morning at \#12. Larry Godwin enjoyed his shoot at \#13. As the season was developing, it was clear that there were more ducks on the marsh, but, with the possible exception of \#12, the quality of the hunting in our ponds was variable and unpredictable.

Wednesday, November 27th: The great chase.

Tuesday was clear and mild; there was a gentle breeze out of the north and the air felt so dry I was certain there wouldn't be any fog in the morning. We walked out the east side to a point opposite \#21 blind and as I looked into the twilight sky, I saw flight after flight of ducks (mostly sprig) coming in from the south and landing in the pond. I put Daisy on leash and as we walked back along the road at the south end of the pond, the ducks continued to swoop in over our heads, well within range.

Dinner was very enjoyable, leg of lamb with wild rice. I slept well and awoke on Wednesday morning to find the sky clear with a gentle wind out of the east. I had a low pick and went to \#26A. The morning was beautifully clear but the wind was sporadic. So was my shooting. It took nineteen cartridges to get three teal and one mallard. I totally missed shots at one flock of teal and missed another three shots at a flock of sea ducks at which I shouldn't have shot at all. Twice when several teal came in, I hit the first one but failed to dismount the gun and pivot properly before firing at the others. I was very happy to see several flocks of 30-50 teal, a sign that the northern birds were arriving at our marsh.

Daisy performed like a ball player who strikes out in the early innings but comes through in the bottom of the ninth with the game winning hit. She totally failed to find one teal that came down next to the blind; I had to retrieve it myself. She found and started to chew another one before I could get it away from her. She did make a routine retrieve on the third one. Around 9:30 I hit a mallard with my third shot. It came down about 70 yards south of the blind. The mallard was very lively and Daisy chased it all around the pond. The duck was swimming with its beak barely above water and would dive whenever Daisy closed in on it but she persevered and after a long pursuit, finally caught it. When she brought it to me, I decided this was a nice way to put period to the morning so I picked up even though it was only 9:30. Instead of going directly in, we took a boat ride and helped Jeff Theibaut and his guest hunt for a crippled bird at \#10 pond. We didn't find it.

I felt contented as I secured my boat at the dock; my shooting could have been much better but Daisy's clutch performance had made it a gratifying morning.[^3]

[^3]: Upon reflection, I think the problem was getting too excited. After taking the first bird of an incoming flight of teal I kept forgetting to dismount the gun and pivot as I should. A possible answer is to visualize, i.e. mentally rehearse the correct shooting technique.

Bag: 3 teal, 1 mallard. Shots fired - 19; ratio = 4.75.

Other: We had an ample and excellent lunch of roast chicken, roasted potatoes and asparagus. Frank and Mike Corsetti went to \#21, had many birds over them and brought in five good ducks. Les Vacari got the limit at \#12. Jim Graziani had a fair shoot at \#7 and Steve Lyon caught a striped bass off the inner boat dock.

Saturday, November 30th: The vanishing act.

No one had to work on the Friday after Thanksgiving, so the boat was scheduled for 2:00 o'clock. The afternoon was bright and clear and the scenery exceptionally beautiful. (It would have been perfect for John Batley, who would arrive the following week.) Daisy and I took a long walk on the west side road but stopped and turned around just short of \#11 pond because we didn't want to disturb the many ducks we saw resting on the \#12-\#15 pond. Except for these birds, we didn't see very much. After our dinner of braised short ribs, I took Daisy for another short walk and settled down for a good night's sleep.

On Saturday morning the sky was clear overhead but high clouds could be seen in the west -- the vanguard of an approaching storm front. Chris Charles invited me to shoot with him in \#23. Shortly after shooting time I brought down a teal with my first shot; Daisy made a routine retrieve. And that was the total morning's action. We did see a few ducks but they stayed well away from our blind. The many ducks we'd seen during the past weeks had apparently left for parts unknown.

Bag: 1 teal. Shots fired - 1; ratio = 1.00.

Other: Shooting was very poor throughout the club. Fifteen shooters brought in a grand total of seventeen birds although Les Vacari and his guest did enjoy a fairly good shoot at \#12. They also caught several striped bass on Friday afternoon. Frank got two sprig at \#21.

Wednesday, December 4th: A nondescript morning.

The tide was so low on Tuesday that we had to land at Wheeler Island. Daisy and I walked over to the club. After she was fed we took a short walk to the gate but it was too dark to see any ducks. Dinner consisted of an excellent barbecued leg of lamb accompanied by asparagus and hollandaise sauce, with zambione for desert.

On Wednesday morning Kurt Koeppen invited me to shoot with him at \#12. I took him out in my boat but mistakenly went into \#11 pond. We lost a few minutes but it didn't matter because at shooting time nothing was flying. The sky was carpeted with a high overcast with gradually lowered in front of another approaching storm. There was very little wind. Around 9:00 o'clock a bank of fog came in from the east, reducing visibility in the pond to approximately 250 yards; it drifted away after 30 minutes. During that time I mistakenly shot a bufflehead drake. It was a handsome bird so I contributed it to the taxidermy project. Early in the morning Kurt hit a widgeon which sailed a long way toward the road. Daisy and I went out after it and after a long search she found it. During the search she put up a pheasant. It was an extremely quiet morning. However, Kurt got two widgeon and one teal. I shot poorly, missing shots at two flights of teal.

Bag: 1 bufflehead. Shots fired - 8; ratio = 8.00.

Other: TIm Murphy and Steve Lyon got eight ducks at \#21. Rich Vacari had a fairly good shoot at \#7; he brought in two teal and one sprig.

Saturday December 7th: Almost perfect.

On this hunt the members of St. Germain enjoyed an outstanding cioppino dinner, an equally delicious lunch of hangtown fry, clay target shooting with the new 12 and 20 bore Sporting guns from Holland & Holland and the company of a delightful guest, John Batley. In addition to being Britain's leading professional pigeon guide and an agent for Holland & Holland, John has a regular column in the Shooting Times and he was planning to write a series of articles about the shooting scene in California and Oregon. There was only one little fly in the ointment -- the ducks didn't cooperate.

The weather seemed to be ideal. A storm was forecast for late Saturday and on Friday afternoon the sky was thinly overcast, although there wasn't any wind. A 2:00 o'clock boat made it possible for Daisy and I to take John out for a long walk. We started out on Division Road but turned back at the near end of \#4 pond because we didn't want to disturb the many ducks that we saw.

During the cocktail hour John and our members shared their respective experiences. John showed his video about decoying pigeon. His pigeon tactics have some similarities to our style of duck hunting. Needless to say, the dinner conversation was livelier than usual.[^4]

[^4]: John would later write: "The wine and conversation flowed late into the night and I eventually tumbled into my bed nearer to the dawn than I would have wished."

Mike Corsetti kindly let us use his first choice and recommended that we go to \#21. That's what we did but the morning was very slow. Our sole duck, a teal, was the product of Anglo-American collaboration. I called it in, John shot it (with the Holland 20 bore) and Daisy retrieved it. A few other shots at rather distant ducks produced zero results. Sadly, the morning was one the season's slowest.

However, there was great shooting at the club. Before lunch, John let us shoot the Holland guns at clay targets launched from the club room deck. Everyone marveled at the guns' superb balance, exceptional quality and beautiful finish. I particularly liked the 20 while the 12 bore was the popular favorite.

Bag: Skunked.

Wednesday, December 11: In the Shadow of the Buttes (or, You Should Have Been Here Yesterday).

A series of warm Pacific storms paraded through northern California and on Tuesday afternoon John and I drove to Colusa where we were to be hosted by Harold (Babe) Balzer at the East Morgan Duck Club. After settling into our assigned trailer, we partook of pre-dinner refreshments in Jack Bruton's trailer and were enthralled with reports of the sensational shooting the club had enjoyed that very day. Babe and his friends took us to dinner at Lovie's Landing, a country restaurant on the bank of the Sacramento River. When I walked through the door, I thought I'd gone through a time warp, the establishment felt so much like the places where my Dad and I used to eat on our duck hunting trips in the 1950's.

The wind howled all night promising a great day's shooting. In the morning we drove about five miles from the trailer court to a parking lot near the flooded rice fields where the blinds are situated. We travelled about another mile on ATV's and then made our way though the mud about 150 yards further to the blind I was sharing with Babe. The morning was grey and a strong wind was blowing out of the south. We saw thousands of ducks in the air but they were all high, one more instance of being a day late. John shot a spoonie and was happy, "I got a duck!"[^5] Babe and I got skunked. Never mind, it was an enjoyable experience and John was well pleased with the photographs and material he gathered for his articles.

[^5]: In the course of our wide ranging conversations, John commented that spoonies, (he calls them shovelers, their proper name), are not disdained by inland wildfowlers in Britain. The most likely explanation is that, as in Minnesota, the British spoonies eat mostly grain and other farm crops.

Saturday, December 14th: Novel experiences.

Friday afternoon found John and me on the 4:00 o'clock boat heading across the river under a crystal clear sky. By this time, it felt like John was a long-time member of the club. Sadly, Daisy wasn't with us. She had cut her leg while hunting pheasants at Black Point and the vet put her on injured reserve for twelve days. We missed her during our afternoon walk on the east side. The sunset was pretty but very few birds were about. One humorous note, when we heard Frank and Mike Mendez practicing their mallard calls, John cupped his hands and answered with the cooing call of a woodpigeon. During cocktail hour, Les Vacari reassured us that there were plenty of new ducks on our marsh.

Dinner was an hour late but the delay was forgotten when it reached the table. Mark Vogel served osso bucco and polenta with an exquisite mushroom sauce and apple Brown Betty for desert.

Saturday morning was clear with a gentle breeze from the east. Jim and Bandit hosted us at \#8. Jim and I settled into the double blind on the large island while John used some net, brush and PVC pipe to improvise a "mini pigeon hide" from which to take pictures while we shot. Believe it or not the ducks cooperated for a change and we had some good chances. I shot two widgeon and Jim used the Holland 12 bore to bring down five ducks without a miss. Bandit contributed to the enjoyment by going more than 300 yards to make a sensational retrieve of a hen mallard which Chuck Yirchott brought down at the far edge of \#10 pond. During a quiet interval, Jim played "God Save the Queen" on his Wingsetter call, at which John removed his cap and stood to attention. Fortunately the clear morning provided ample light for John's photography.

As were driving home, John told me he had a wonderful time at St. Germain and I already knew that the members had greatly enjoyed his visit.

Bag: 2 widgeon. Shots fired - 8; ratio = 4.00.

Other: Shooting was fairly good on the west side but slow on the east side. Enough ducks were brought in for John to take some "happy hunter" group pictures. Steve Lyon and his guest made the most of their only opportunity and got a pair of mallards at \#21.

Saturday December 21st: Soaking Wet Solstice.

John flew home on Monday afternoon and I decided to work rather than go hunting on Wednesday. Although Daisy would still be out of action I was looking forward to Saturday. I had first choice and Jim Graziani saved my morning by agreeing to help me hunt \#12 pond with Bandit. Les Vacari had also offered assistance. After making friends with a pretty calico cat at the McAvoy dock, he volunteered to hunt with me using the cat as a retriever. I gave Les high marks for creativity but decided to stick with Bandit.

Friday was a typical dreary mid-December day, foggy, murky, a bitingly cold wind from the east and horizontal visibility no more than a mile. I missed Daisy on my short pre dinner walk and saw nothing in the dim light.

After dining on New York steak and raviolis, I got a mild surprise when I went out for another short walk. The weather had changed dramatically. The fog was gone, horizontal visibility was unlimited and I saw the lights of Sacramento reflected in the high overcast that covered the sky. A mild wind was blowing out of the south.

Rain was forecast for that night and shortly after I settled into bed, it started falling. And it didn't stop. Saturday morning found a number of members doubtful about going out at all. Les Vacari declared, "My cat does not go out in the rain!" Our marsh generally doesn't shoot well in the rain. On the other hand, I've had some good results in the rain, so Bandit, Jim and I braced ourselves and set out for \#12 pond. I took the inner island, Jim took the point blind and we had a good morning. My shooting was decent but not brilliant. I missed some easy birds but made some difficult shots, the most noteworthy, a widgeon that helicoptered down almost on top of Jim. Jim also made a nice shot on a sprig. Overeager once again, I shot a spoonie in the dim light shortly after shooting time. Later, I did enjoy calling in the spoonies and going through the firing drill as they circled around my blind. We quit around 10:00 o'clock. The rain stung my face as I sped down Noyce Slough to the dock and I was cold, wet and tired, but very contented.

Bag: 2 widgeon, 3 teal, 1 sprig and 1 spoonie. Shots fired - 24, ratio 3.43.

Other: Shooting was slow in our other blinds but Al Martinelli got 5 teal at \#7. Gary Cushman bagged a mallard at \#15.

December 26th-28th: Post Christmas excursion.

On the day after Christmas, I went on a three-day excursion to the marsh. Unfortunately, nearly all the ducks decided to take the same days off. There had been a series of moderate storms from Sunday through Wednesday and an extremely strong storm was forecast for Saturday night. Apparently the weather chased most of the birds off the marsh.

Six of us left McAvoy at 1:00 o'clock on Thursday afternoon and crossed the river in a light rain. I was delighted that Daisy had been cleared to come with me. We were planning a short afternoon hunt and Jim Koeppen suggested I go to \#28. I decided to hunt with style, John Batley style that is. I put on a cravat and went out with my Beretta over/under and some 20 bore Holland & Holland bismuth cartridges John had given me. After setting a dozen teal decoys next to the island and a few mallards about 20 yards further out, I settled into the blind under a lowering grey sky with a northeast and the barest sprinkle of rain. Almost no ducks were flying but a flock of four teal did come to my decoys. I downed one with my second barrel. Daisy got into the spirit of the afternoon and retrieved it with appropriate aplomb. I'd accomplished what I set out to do and was very contented.

About fifteen minutes before closing time heavy rain began falling around Mt. Diablo and I decided to go in. It was a good move. As I was securing my boat at the dock, the sky opened up and it poured so heavily that I stayed at the dock until it eased off.

Frank Fiala cooked a tasty dinner of pork chops, rice and lima beans with a salad of lettuce, tomatoes and artichoke hearts. The floor of my boat room was very wet so I put Daisy in Bandit's room. The rain continued for most of the night.

On Friday morning I went to \#4 and fired one shot at a mallard at marginal range. That was the only duck I saw. But there were plenty of cormorants, more than I've seen in a long time. A beautiful variety of clouds was the morning's only positive note. I picked up before ten o'clock, took a long boat ride around the club, checked the ponds at Sprig Farm but didn't see any ducks.

For lunch Jim Koeppen prepared a hearty stew which perfectly suited the day. I took a long nap in the afternoon until 4:30, when the regular Friday afternoon party arrived. Our cook was away but Jim Graziani prepared an outstanding dinner featuring scampi sauted in white wine and garlic. The desert was Muriel's plum pudding over which I poured enough brandy to keep the flame going for ten minutes.

I had third choice on Saturday and invited Larry Godwin to come to \#12 with us. He got the total "Daisy experience." As he was pulling his boat past the inner blind to hide it in the channel, she raised her hackles and gave him a ferocious growl. Larry was a bit shaken but was reassured when I told Daisy to calm down. The sunrise was dramatic, a angry red sky heralding the approaching storm. We had only a few shooting opportunities and I was able to bring down two teal out of the several flocks that came to my decoys. Several times the teal surprised me and were gone before I could shoot. Late in the morning a spoonie flew over the outer blind. Larry fired one shot and then yelled "Spoonie." I fired anyway and brought it down. The bird was a diver and Daisy chased it around the pond before bringing it in. Then she dropped it and it scurried in to the water. Daisy chased it again and I thought she had lost it in the pickleweed by the ditch. She kept hunting during the twenty minutes it took me to get my boat and pick up the decoys. Eventually she found the bird in the tulles by the slough about 250 yards east of the blind. This retrieve was her career best. Larry was impressed; quote, "she's tough as nails with a heart of gold."

Bag: 3 teal and 1 spoonie. Shots fired - 14, ratio 3.5. Season total 40 consisting of 3 mallard, 3 sprig, 9 widgeon, 17 teal, 1 gadwall, 6 spoonies and 1 bufflehead.

Other: Jim Graziani and his guest George Bignotti went to \#10 where Jim shot a mallard with his Perazzi MX-3. Otherwise shooting was poor all over the club.

Saturday, January 4th: Drying out.

A series of tropical storms brought record rainfall and serious flooding throughout Northern California. Tuesday's strong winds prompted cancellation of the club's traditional New Year's Eve party. During the Friday crossing we saw some of the storm's effects. The river was brown and full of water hyacinth and other debris from the flooding. We ran at reduced speed as lookouts on the foredeck kept a careful watch for partially submerged logs and other hazards. Our harbor was covered with water hyacinth and other detritus that had been swept in by the wind and tides.

The club facilities survived undamaged although there was some concern about the state of the levee near Wheeler Island. I took a walk with Daisy out to the near end of \#4 pond. After a week of rain it was a pleasure to walk in the warm sunshine, although there very few ducks flying. We did see six geese resting on the Rich Island pond next to the road, about a dozen mallards were resting on high ground near the road and using my field glasses, I thought I saw some sprig on the high ground between \#21 and \#23 ponds.

Jim Graziani and Chris Charles prepared a dinner of barbecued lamb which was excellent. Because of the damp floor in my boat room, Bandit again let Daisy share his quarters.

It turned much cooler on Saturday morning; the sky was thinly overcast with a moderate southwest wind. I had a low blind draw and went to \#4 and shared that end of the pond with Jim, who was in \#5. I listened to the 49er game and performed about as well as the team did. I had three shooting opportunities at teal and fired six cartridges without effect. In mid morning a flock of 50-60 white terns flew down the pond at eye-level in an "S" pattern and while I was picking up the decoys, a goose flew overhead at 50 yards. However, the sight of several large flocks of ducks at very high altitude making their way back to the marsh gave me hope that the shooting would improve in a few days.

Jim shot a grand total of one teal which he put it in his jacket pocket. When it was time to pick up his decoys he took off the jacket and left it on the island. Bandit pulled the teal out and was starting to eat it when Jim caught him.

Shooting was poor all over the club; seventeen hunters brought in a total of nine ducks. Jim Koeppen and Larry Godwin were high Guns. They hunted \#28 pond and brought in a teal, a widgeon and a ruddy duck.

An incident worthy of Max Sennet took place at \#8 and \#10 ponds. However, before relating it, I should emphasize that everybody at our club takes gun safety very seriously, no one more Frank Fiala, a certified skeet instructor, Les Vacari, who has hunted all his life, and Gary Cushman, an ex-Marine. Gary was shooting at \#8 and hit a duck that sailed a distance and landed at the edge of \#10 pond. When Gary went to chase it, the bird swam in the general direction of \#10 blind, where Frank and Les were hunting. Gary wanted to shoot at the duck on the water, and he called out "Duck!" Frank stood up and looked around. Gary called again and Frank asked "Where?" When Gary saw the angle was safe, he fired at the bird whereupon Les stood up and waved his handkerchief as a surrender flag. Gary doubled up with laughter and was unable to continue the chase.

Bag: skunked.

Wednesday January 8, 1997: By the skin of our teeth.

On this hunt we were thinking about more than ducks. Wednesday noon would bring the winter's highest tide. There was great concern that the river would overflow our levee because of the high tide combined with the run off from the previous week's rains. On Tuesday afternoon the St. Germain made three crossings to take 200 cement bags, each weighing 60 pounds, to build up the lowest point of our levee where it makes the curve next to Andronico's dock. I took the 4:00 o'clock boat; the dock was awash when we arrived. The younger and stronger members immediately set to placing the last of the bags along the levee.

At noon on Wednesday, the river came within inches of spilling over the cement bags, and then gradually receded. The crisis had passed. Ironically, what probably saved our club was the stagnant mid-winter weather that usually ruins the late season hunting. A ridge of high pressure over the Northwest had brought windless and dry weather to Northern California and, of course, dense fog to our marsh. Never mind, our club survived the flood intact, the only problem spots on the levee being a small overflow between Division Road and Rich Island and some water percolating through the levee east of Wheeler Island.

Shooting was almost an afterthought. Jim Graziani and I took Richard and Michael Flocchini to the "big pond." Jim and Rich went to \#7, I took Michael to \#5 and then settled into \#4. I had three chances at teal, two of them marginal, and fired six rounds without effect. Michael bagged a teal and a goldeneye and Jim got two teal. The sky was full of cormorants, not ducks, including several very large flocks of the "black beauties." The fog shrouded our pond and then lifted three separate times. All in all, with its minimum of heart-pounding excitement, the morning would have been a cardiologist's delight. That's all right, we enough excitement along the levee.

Bag. Skunked.

Other. On Tuesday evening we dined on buffalo roast, courtesy of Rich Flocchini. During the cocktail hour we also enjoyed some of his antelope salami and a smoked pheasant which Chuck Yirchott donated. At breakfast, Al Martinelli remarked that the pancakes tasted different, "good, but different." They were different; Jim Koeppen had spiked the batter with vodka. As expected, the morning's shooting was generally poor, a 1-2 bird average per hunter (and not all good birds), except for Rich Vacari who went to \#8 and got five teal, a mallard and a widgeon.

Saturday, January 11th: Ladies Night.

During the several calm, dry days that followed the January deluge the ducks filtered back to the marsh. So did the fog. It was so thick on Friday afternoon that the crossing was made in zero visibility. Jim Graziani, who was piloting the St. Germain, and lost his way in the fog. He came within twenty yards of the shore east of Wheeler Island and had to slowly feel his way west along the shore to our dock club. I stayed home on Friday and on Saturday took Muriel to the club for the Ladies Night party that evening. During the afternoon I conducted the ladies on a nature walk out the west side to the vicinity of \#11 pond. We saw a few ducks and a hunter in on of Rich Island's blinds who was less than enthusiastic about our presence and didn't hesitate to let us know how he felt.

Saturday's dinner featured an excellent filet mignon. Sunday morning was bitterly cold with fog and a misty rain, a real "beast of a morning."[^6] Daisy was not well so I slept in and around 8:00 o'clock, took Muriel for a boat ride around the club. We saw large numbers of ducks in the area from \#8 pond to Pelican Point. We took the early boat home and brought Daisy to the emergency hospital where she was diagnosed as having an intestinal infection.

[^6]: A wonderful phrase borrowed from the Shooting Times.

Wednesday, January 15th: Ideal Conditions.

Fortunately, Daisy responded well to treatment. On Tuesday she almost back to normal but not quite ready to go hunting. The afternoon was very cold and rain was forecast for that night. I took a solitary walk out on the east side under a lowering grey sky. Several hundred ducks got up; they had been sheltering from the north wind next to the road where it runs between the near end of \#21 pond and the Andronico property.

I had first choice on Wednesday and invited Jim Graziani, George Couch and, of course, Bandit, to join me at \#8 pond. There was no fog but the morning was extremely dark. Going out to the pond in the face of the strong north wind and driving rain, I felt more like a storm tossed sailor on an uncharted sea than a duck hunter on a familiar slough. I ran at reduced power and felt a sense of relief when I reached the entry channel. I chose the entrance blind while Jim and George took the center island. While I was setting my decoys the rain stopped but the wind continued to blow hard. The morning was all a duck hunter could wish for. The wind stirred up the birds while the grey sky made concealment and sky watching far easier than on a clear day. Horizontal visibility was absolutely clear and under the cloud-filled sky, the surrounding hills had an understated beauty about them.

As they tend to do in late season, the teal flew wildly in large flocks. I called one teal to the decoys and brought it down and connected with two others on difficult high passing shots. I also brought down a widgeon which came over the blind to my call. My performance was far from perfect, however, I passed up some shots I should have taken, had teal race by me before I could mount the gun and lost a teal that swam away before Bandit and I could get to it. Jim and George also had a good morning, accounting for eight ducks between them. In sum, the morning was one of the season's most enjoyable with perfect weather, lots of birds to see, plenty of action and a few good shots. It's a pity Daisy had to miss it, but in light of her recent illness, it's for the best that she stayed out of the wind and the cold.

Other: Rich Vacari was high Gun. He went to \#12, shot the inner blind and limited out but his bag included two spoonies. The quality award went to Mike Corsetti, who went to \#21 and brought in 2 sprig and a widgeon.

Bag: 3 teal and 1 widgeon. Shots fired 13 (not counting 3 shots fired on the water at downed birds); Ratio - 3.25.

Saturday, January 18th: A not so grand finale.

Friday afternoon was a typical January day on the marsh, cold north wind, high fog. I took the 2:00 o'clock boat and learned from the shooters who had gone out that morning that the ducks had been flying in good numbers, and that the shooting had been fairly good.

I was happy to have Daisy with me. We took a long walk on the east side out to the boundary of Sprig Farm. As we approached the near end of \#21 pond, almost 100 spoonies got up from the area of Andronico's pond near the levee. We also saw many diving ducks on our ponds, well over 100 on \#28 pond. We also saw many sprig, widgeon and teal sheltering in the small ponds on the Sprig Farm side of the channel. We also saw a few flocks flying; they appeared to be mostly spoonies.

Friday's closing dinner couldn't have been better, barbecued pork spare ribs with potato spears and cole slaw so good I had seconds. This was followed by chocolate ice cream with chocolate syrup.

I thought we might be fogged out on Saturday. As it turned out there was some high fog but horizontal visibility was about one mile. There was a cold wind out of the east and the morning was the dreariest of the season. I had a low choice and went to \#4. The pond was several inches lower because of the pumping. There were ducks flying in the early part of the morning but they were high. A pair of teal came to my decoys and I brought one down with my second shot. Daisy made a routine retrieve. Later in the morning I fired two shots at a passing widgeon at extreme range without effect. This morning was as bleak and discouraging as Wednesday's had been stimulating. I didn't really mind picking up my decoys and heading back to the dock for the last time.

Other: Shooting was poor throughout the club. Mike Corsetti got three good ducks at \#7 blind and Gary Cushman doubled on gadwall at \#28. Several of our shooters got skunked.

Bag: 1 teal. Shots fired 4; Ratio - 4.00 Season total 45 consisting of 3 mallard, 3 sprig, 10 widgeon, 21 teal, 1 gadwall, 6 spoonies and 1 bufflehead. 84.5% good ducks. Season Total shots fired 161; ratio = 3.578.

Final Reflections.

It might have been Saturday's weather or maybe it was just time to quit. In any event, I didn't really mind picking up the decoys and heading back to the dock.

I've never had a better season both in terms of numbers and enjoyment. Regarding numbers, my observations and results bore out the pre-season prediction of more ducks in the flyway. Without doubt the Batley visit, the generally favorable weather, the consistently excellent meals and company at the club and at long last, the availability of a truly effective non-toxic cartridge, all contributed to this being one of my most enjoyable duck seasons.
