1990-91 SPRIG FARM DIARY

(or "The Adventures of Daisy")

Introduction: This season marks the debut of Daisy, our year and one-half old female black Labrador Retriever; I hope the readers will enjoy following her exploits as the season progresses. This journal, like last year's, will record the physical and technical aspects of my hunting experiences which make each visit to Sprig Farm just a little different, as well as some of the human interest stories which make the place so enjoyable.

\---

Prologue: We made two trips to Sprig Farm with Daisy before the season started. Our first visit, in early September, introduced her to the Marsh and she eagerly took the water (no surprise), and retrieved dummies David tossed across Roaring River. We returned on October 20th. By this time the ponds were flooded and Daisy took her first boat ride. Muriel and I had to pull her on board because she was afraid to get into the boat by herself. The day was warm, clear and generally pleasant. During our ride we saw hundreds of mallards in the area of the Club which spans Blinds \#5A through \#8.

\---

October 27th: Season Opens. Friday's ride to the Marsh mirrored much of last season, warm afternoon, light winds and Mt. Diablo barely visible though the autumn haze. A cloud of mosquitoes formed a welcoming committee at the gate. Later that afternoon, I had to cut short my walk because the mosquitoes were so numerous and aggressive. I drew eighth choice and selected Blind \#2 because it looked like the best available blind with an island for the dog.

Saturday dawned clear with a southwest wind blowing at no more than 10 knots. As I started setting out my decoys, Daisy attempted to retrieve same; I had tell her "NO!" several times. I thought she got the message but when I returned to the island after hiding the boat, I found five decoys lined up alongside the barrel. (She'll have to learn what the limit is.)

The shooting started slow but about 7:20 I brought down a widgeon with a single shot. The wounded bird started swimming for the south shore but Daisy retrieved it and brought it to hand. A good start. A few minutes later I brought down a mallard which swam into the pickleweed about 70 yards south of the blind. I went with Daisy and happened to see the bird before she did. A while later I fired at a flock of ducks and hit one which sailed about 150 yards to the northeast corner of the pond alongside the canal. I took Daisy with me and set her hunting in the tall grass. After a few minutes of coursing back and forth, she found the bird, which had burrowed into the grass. It turned out to be a spoonie but I really didn't mind because this was Daisy's first scent retrieve. Around 9 o'clock I shot another widgeon which fell into the decoys; Daisy made a routine retrieve. I packed up and took a boat ride around the west side before coming in.

It had been a very satisfying morning. Daisy did very well on her first outing (and, incidentally, quickly lost any timidity about getting in the boat). I shot reasonably well (13 rounds expended with some misses on marginal chances). I was pleased with the Briley choked 26 in. barrel and my new Federal shells with 1-1/8 oz. No. 2 shot. Bag: 1 mallard, 2 widgeon and 1 spoonie.

Other: Friday's cocktail hour and dinner exceeded previous high standards. The steaks, to put it mildly, were superb. Hari Monteith's salmon mousse was delicious as usual. Al White and Bill Richardson brought up a tub of fresh prawns from Swann's, and to top off the meal, Al opened a bottle of 150 year-old Grand Marnier with desert, which consisted of bakery delicacies donated by Mike and Hari.

Nearly everyone limited. Mike Monteith earned the high gun award for bagging 3 mallards and 1 teal in 30 minutes at \#7.

Someone mentioned that according to the wardens, there are twice as many birds on the Marsh this year. The large number of widgeon and spoonies suggests an early migration.

On the way back from the blind to the clubhouse, I saw a flight of 5 brown pelicans over the holding pond. They are huge birds, bigger than geese, and I don't remember seeing pelicans over the club before.

October 31st: Weatherwise, this was my most enjoyable hunt in recent memory. Overnight, a moderate Pacific front brought about .15 inches of rain to San Francisco. Driving into the Marsh, I was treated to a haze-free sky covered with a variety of frontal system clouds. The mosquitoes at the gate and on my walk were less numerous but still bothersome. Fred Ellers came along on our walk and saw Daisy flush her first pheasant. We walked west along the outside road and saw very few ducks. Earlier that afternoon, Fred had seen many mallards in the burned area by Blind \#1.

I picked Blind \#8, my old favorite, and got there in time to set the decoys and be ready at shooting time. It had started raining shortly before 4:00 a.m. and light showers continued on and off until around 10:00 a.m. when the front passed through, The wind was from the southwest at 15 knots.

I missed on my first two shooting opportunities but then hit with four successive shots and had my limit (all widgeon) by 10 o'clock. What made the morning most enjoyable was the beautiful sky and the number of ducks in the air. While looking around at the neighboring blinds, I saw Dean double on mallards at \#6.

Daisy originally would not settle down but she improved as the morning went on. She learned to stay down and keep the camo net over her. She made two unassisted retrieves and two where I had to show her where the bird was. Twice she went out on her own after ducks that landed in the pond. I was blindsided a couple of times but didn't mind this because this meant that Daisy wasn't scaring the ducks away. Bag: 4 widgeon.

We had eight shooters; several limited and most got at least one mallard or sprig.

Other: According to the game book, shooting was poor on Sunday; four shooters got only three birds.

Joe served an excellent soup for lunch.

\---

November 3rd: Friday afternoon was clear with a strong north wind. Daisy and I took a long walk on the Roaring River Road opposite the east side of the club. I saw hundreds of widgeon working the state ponds next to the Grizzly Island Road. Daisy flushed another pheasant and chased her first rabbit. At sunset, the wind died down and the mosquitoes chased us back to the clubhouse.

On Friday evening Harry Bolye tuned our duck calls and gave us some tips about calling and decoy placement. According to Harry, the keys to successful duck hunting are good calling and smart decoy placement. These bring the ducks in so close that shooting is easy. He does not believe in pass shooting.

I had a fairly low choice and selected Blind \#2. On Saturday morning a light northeast wind was blowing and, because of the full moon, very few ducks were flying. During a full moon they fly and feed all night. I tried set my decoys using the Harry Boyle "mat and hook" pattern. Around 9:00 o'clock I moved the decoys to the other side of the island with the hook pointed downwind in the open water. This took almost 20 minutes. As I was loading my gun after getting back in the blind, three mallards decoyed to the spread. I got the biggest one, a hen, and watched it fall. I should have tried for a double but old habits persist. Daisy made a straightforward unassisted retrieve. Bag: 1 mallard.

Other: Harry Boyle divided Saturday morning among Dean, Mike Monteith, Fred Ellers and myself in our blinds. He described our club as "interesting," and said the facilities "have a lot of charm." Before lunch, he gave a critique of the club which Fred videotaped. He suggests that we get rid of Blinds 4, 12, 14A and 15, move Fred's \#11 to site of old \#11, build up islands around the barrels that don't have them and convert some of the better blinds to doubles. Harry's favorites are \#3 \#1 and \#2. He also feels the water level should be lower.

Dean limited at \#3 in less than an hour; he and Harry were calling ducks away from St. Germain. None of the other shooters did very well.

On the drive home I saw an overturned van about 20 yards off the road by the gas well. I learned later that the driver had fallen asleep at the wheel. He was unhurt and walked to the check stand.

I decided to skip Wednesday because of the warm weather and some work I had to complete. Ironically, there was a strong north wind on Tuesday and everyone at the Club on Wednesday morning had a good shoot.

\---

November 10th (Sat.): Friday afternoon was typical, warm and sunny with a light breeze from the west. I did not see many ducks during the afternoon, but did see 40+ Tulle Elk east of the check stand on the drive in.

On Saturday morning I went to Blind \#8. The wind was from the west but the shooting was very slow. Early in the morning I shot at a mallard which came down over 200 yards towards \#9 pond. I went out with Daisy but we couldn't find any trace of it. Around 9:30 I shot a sprig or a widgeon at long range. The bird fell 80 yards east of the blind, but dove when Daisy went to retrieve it. We spent half hour looking for it without success. At 10:45 I called in and shot a spoonie in order to give Daisy at least a little success. The bird fell about 120 yards toward the house pond; Daisy marked it and made an unassisted retrieve, her longest of the season. Bag: 1 spoonie.

Other: My boat was missing on Friday afternoon. The mooring rope had rotted and it drifted down to the main canal east of Blind \#1, where Dean and I found it.

A swan flew over my pond and landed in \#5A, where Bill Armstrong was shooting.

November 13th: Tuesday afternoon featured an overcast sky and a strong wind blowing from the west; a mild storm sprinkled a little rain on Wednesday morning. On our walk I saw hundreds of teal working the state ponds opposite the east side.

On Wednesday morning I went to Blind \#7 and missed the entrance; I continued around the circle and found it the second time. The sky was overcast and there was a light wind from the southwest. I shot a sprig early and had to be careful the rest of the morning. Daisy made two solid unassisted 80+ yard retrieves of sprig and mallard cripples. I brought down a drake widgeon which dove repeatedly as we chased it for 200 yards; I finally shot it in the water and Daisy picked it up. We lost one diving bird. Bag: 1 sprig, 1 mallard and 1 widgeon

Other: Bill Armstrong had a very interesting guest, Bill Frost, whose family has ranched on Grizzly Island for more than 100 years. Bill was born at the Gum Tree Club and he had many stories about life on the Marsh.

\---

November 17th: Another weak storm front was teasing Northern California on Friday afternoon and there was high overcast and haze. I saw few if any ducks on my walk except for the area north of \#7 pond, where there was a concentration of mallard, widgeon and a few sprig.

A few drops of rain fell Friday evening but Saturday dawned bright and clear, with a fresh wind from the southwest. I went back to \#7 but the morning was very slow. I shot two spoonies during the first three hours. One of them was a diver but Daisy stayed with it until she got it. By 10:30 I had decided to go in when three widgeon landed in the pond about 100 yards west of the blind. I spent the next hour watching them, hoping that they would either swim closer or draw in some other ducks. At 11:30 I unloaded the gun and started putting it in the case. The noise caused the ducks to get off the pond. They circled back over the blind and I managed to load one round and bring one down. Daisy made an easy retrieve. Bag: 2 spoonies and 1 widgeon.

Other: On Friday afternoon I stopped at Bill Frosts's ranch, which is located next to the Montezuma Slough Bridge. Bill showed me his duck pond which was hosting Canadian and Aleutian geese, wood ducks, the usual mallards and even a sprig.

End of the First Half of the Season

December 1st: I had been anxious to get back to Sprig Farm but my first hunt of the second half of the season was disappointing. As Murphy said, "If things can go wrong . . . ." The storms we were hoping for did not materialize and Friday's drive to the marsh was fair and hazy, although it was noticeably cooler and the mosquitoes were almost gone. On our walk I saw a huge concentration of ducks in the holding pond, and some big ducks in the area between Blind \#7 and the road, but not much flying. I did see some Canadian Honkers in the DU ponds.

I had eighth draw and because northwest winds were forecast, chose Blind \#1 on the gamble that, because of the high barometric pressure, we would have a north wind (mistake no. 1; the wind blew from the west, when it did blow). It would have been a much better idea to ask Fred Ellers whether he would like Daisy and me to join him at \#14. Fred had a good shoot with widgeon over his blind all morning. I took some brush to with me to the blind and inadvertently threw it over my ammo bag. After I had set the decoys, I went to the island, didn't see the bag, thought I had left it in my room, and went back to the clubhouse (mistake no. 2). When I got back to the blind, it was light enough to see the bag under the brush. On the way back I saw some widgeon working my decoys. The morning was very, very slow. I half-heartedly fired two rounds at a spoonie (mistake no. 3 [one should concentrate on ducks as much as on clay targets] and at 10:45 was surprised by a sprig overhead which I also missed (mistake no 4 [I should have let him work -- Clay Judd at \#2 saw him circle the pond at least twice]. All in all, it was a disappointing morning. I suppose Daisy had to meet the Skunk sooner or later; when I got back to the Clubhouse I threw some dummies for her so the morning wouldn't be a complete waste of time. Bag: Skunked!

Other: On Friday evening we had a turkey dinner which everybody greatly enjoyed.

I've switched to the full choke tube. The tighter pattern will mean more misses but harder hits and fewer wounded birds flying out of retrieve range.

Blinds \#5, 7, 8, 9 and 14 shot well; I was the only shooter who got skunked.

I still like Blind \#1, but absent a strong north wind, it's simply not a fair weather blind. To look along the flight line you have to fight the morning sun and that's no fun. By contrast, at \#8 (still my favorite although Dean likes \#7 better), you look over the pond away from the sun.

\---

December 5th (Wed.): Tuesday afternoon featured the usual clear, hazy sky; the lack of any serious storms is really worrisome. Daisy and I took a long boat ride, exploring the slough that runs by Blind \#3 until we got well past \#5 Blind. Our walk was shorter than usual but I saw some new and not very nervous birds in the ponds near our gate, and some big birds in the area between \#7 and the levee road.

Fred Ellers picked Blind \#8, so I chose \#7. Actually, most of the shooters were close together, Dean and his guest at \#6, Bill Armstrong and his guest a \#5 and \#5A, and Rusty at \#2. Clay Judd went to \#14 where he got a sprig, a mallard and two teal (high gun). The shaft on my motor broke as I entered \#6 pond on the way to \#7, so I rowed the rest of the way to the blind; Dean towed me back to the clubhouse afterwards.

The morning was partly cloudy; what little wind there was blew from the west. However, there were birds in the air until 9:30 or so. I shot three widgeon and Daisy made routine retrieves, bringing the bird to hand each time. One of her retrieves surprised me -- I didn't realize I had shot the bird. I was concentrating on the lead duck in the flock, missed three shots at it and wondered why Daisy went into water. I thought she was going to retrieve a decoy and was surprised when she swam to the north shore of the pond and came back with a duck in her mouth. Bag: 3 widgeon.

Other; On Tuesday afternoon there were four tulle elk right next to the road opposite the check-in stand.

Joe's Tuesday dinner, swiss steak, was excellent.

Dean and Fred saw many ducks on the Grizzly King ponds. This is very unusual and indicates that new birds are moving in to the marsh.

I think I've found a way to keep Daisy more comfortable and quieter during the morning. I put a space blanket inside a burlap bag to give her a bed with some insulation and warmth.

\---

December 8th: This was my most enjoyable hunt of the season so far, although Friday afternoon was not very promising. There was little wind and the haze was so thick that visibility was less than three miles. On the way in I stopped by Grizzly King and watched hundreds of ducks on their ponds. I think most of them were widgeon but it was hard to see clearly because of the glare and haze. I waked east along the levee road for a mile or so and saw a few ducks on the state ponds, but nothing spectacular.

On Saturday morning I went to Blind \#8. When I set the decoys the breeze was from the west, but about sunrise it stopped and then started coming from the east, gradually shifting to north, at 8-10 mph. I moved the decoys so they were concentrated around the island, with "wings" sweeping downwind on both sides. This was a perfect setup. Flocks of widgeon worked my blind all morning, and I enjoyed "talking" to them with the widgeon call. Daisy made a sensational retrieve on a widgeon whuch flew to the grass 120 yards north of the blind before it dropped. She swam across the pond into the general area and then found the bird with her nose. Fred in \#9 and Dean in \#7 heard me calling "Good Dog! Good Dog!" Later that morning she made a scent retrieve on a sprig that fell in the pickleweed 70-80 yards east of the blind. Her third retrieve was a diving widgeon than came down near the blind. She also stayed down and quiet although I had to watch her closely and tell her "no" when she started to move. Bag: 1 sprig and 2 widgeon.

Other: Dean replaced the shear pin in my motor, and also changed the oil; it's now running perfectly.

Mike Monteith brought an interesting guest, Hugh de Penethy O'Kelly, a gunsmith who grew up in South Africa, worked for Weatherby and now has a shop in Santa Rosa. He feels that the best values in over/under guns are the Belgium and Citori Brownings, with the edge to Citori, and the Beretta. He's also an avid sporting clays shooter. They had a good shoot in \#14 where Cosby made an outstanding 200+ yard retrieve on a drake mallard.

\---

December 15th: This was a day of great promise and meager results. Friday was foggy and dreary, but a storm was forecasted with "more energy than any this season," so my hopes were high. I had a fairly high blind draw but \#8 and \#7 were taken when my turn came so I took \#5, banking on the strong west winds which were predicted to follow the storm front. On Friday's walk, I saw a number of mallards in the little bay behind \#5, and plenty of ducks all over the west side, so I was excited about the next morning's prospects.

Saturday morning arrived cold, dark and rainy. There was a light east wind at shooting time but as the morning passed, it shifted and blew hard from the west. I moved the decoys twice. The view from the blind was beautiful, the sky full of dramatic clouds and the surrounding hills clearly visible. The only problem was that there were few birds over my blind. I shot a drake spoonie early on, but that was it. Daisy made a routine retrieve. I stayed out until 11:30 and came back to the clubhouse cold, a little wet and tired. Bag: 1 spoonie.

Other: On Friday afternoon while walking along the levee road opposite \#5 Daisy chased and caught what looked like a young otter. Before the rodent escaped it bit Daisy's left jowl and cut her nose. I had to use my handkerchief to stop the bleeding and walk her back to the clubhouse with my belt as a leash. Mike Monteith put some antibiotic ointment on her wounds and I kept her quiet the rest of the evening. It is probably just as well that there was so little work for her the next morning.

Mike at \#7 and Dean at \#8 both had good mornings; Dean shot a box and a half of shells. Fred downed a mallard at \#14 but couldn't find it. After lunch Mike and Cosby went after it and Cosby quickly found the bird.

On Saturday afternoon there were about 15 marsh elk right next to the road by the check stand.

I'm switching back to the modified choke because I think the full choke pattern is too tight at medium range (30-35 yds.).

\---

December 22nd: We will be talking abut this shoot for years to come. Friday afternoon was crystal clear as the result of a record cold wave which gripped Northern California. On our walk I noticed some ice on the ponds. I've never seen more ducks in the Marsh. There were clouds of ducks over the state ponds opposite \#12. I had a low blind draw and, because of the north wind, chose \#1.

On Friday night the temperature dropped to 18 degrees. The pipes froze and we had to use water from the slough to flush the toilets; there was no water for washing. As I went down the main channel I could hear my boat breaking ice, and half way down the boat ditch to \#1 the ice was so thick that I had to leave the boat and go in on foot. The going was very difficult, I had to break the ice at each step and then lift my foot out of the ice to make the next step. The pond was frozen solid so I couldn't use decoys. The morning was spectacular. Huge flocks of ducks -- much too high to shoot -- were moving all the time; unfortunately, they weren't a bit interested in my frozen pond. After an hour I shot a bird which came down about 200 yards east of me. Daisy and I started out and ordinarily would have had a good chance of finding it, but this morning the going was impossible. I got so tired trying to break through the ice that I went to the boat and came back to the clubhouse.

About 10:30 Mike came in from \#7 and said he could have shot 60 sprig, so I decided to give it a try. I picked up my gear from \#1, went to \#7, set a dozen decoys in a patch of open water and was back in business by 11:30. By 12:30 I had a limit, 3 widgeon and a spoonie; all had fallen within 30 yards of the blind. Daisy made her first double retrieve, although she had trouble with the ice. The number of ducks in the air made that hour at \#7 pass very quickly. Bag: 3 widgeon and 1 spoonie.

Other: On Friday night we had our annual duck barbecue. Al White presided over the coals as per custom. This year's dinner was better than ever, probably because he cooked mallard instead of sprig. Our wines for the evening were Domaine Chandon Cuvee Club and Mumms Napa Cuvee with pate before dinner, and with the duck, three cabernets, 1973 Lynch-Bages, 1980 Vichon (Fay Vineyard) and 1985 BV Private Reserve. The BV is very drinkable now, but needs another eight years or so to mature.

Saturday afternoon we saw hundred of ducks, mostly sprig and widgeon, huddled together on the shores of the house pond. They would get up, fly around, and then return to the same spot.

Al White shot a Canada goose on Sunday.

\---

December 28th and 29th: This was Christmas week, so we skipped Wednesday and had a two day shoot on Friday and Saturday. Dean, Rusty, Mike and I met for lunch at the Holiday Inn in Fairfield (a nice place to eat) and then went out to Birds Landing to shoot sporting clays. We all had a great time and want to go back. Because of the freeze, the water situation at Sprig Farm was dubious so we brought some bottled water for drinking and washing. I visited John at Balboa Farm and arrived too late to take much of a walk, but saw plenty of ducks on the property, although not nearly as many as the previous week.

On Friday morning I went to Blind 8 and set the decoys around the island with "wings" stretching out to the east and west. The sky was hazy and there was little wind, but the shooting was excellent. I was shooting confidently after Thursday's sporting clays and brought down a big sprig with my first shot. Then I spent the rest of the morning calling ducks and generally enjoying myself because there were so many ducks to watch. A large duck flew toward me with the slow, shallow wing beat of a mallard looking for a place to land. I brought it down with the first shot at about 40 yards and was surprised when it turned out to be a drake widgeon. I shot another widgeon and around 10:30, fired at a duck that was at least 50 yards directly overhead, it fell almost within my reach and turned out to be a spoonie. Daisy made four routine retrieves. Bag: 1 sprig, 2 widgeon and 1 spoonie.

On Friday afternoon, Mike and I took a Cosby and Daisy for a walk. We were both a little tired and intended to turn around at the gate, but the afternoon was so pleasant and there were so many ducks around that we kept walking and went about a mile further along the levee road opposite the east side. We saw more ducks than we had seen in years, although many of them were spoonies. We saw a 50 plus "V" of spoonies in the air; this is most unusual.

I had mastered the situation on Friday; Saturday's tale would be different. A cold 20+ knot wind blew from the north, the kind of weather that duck hunters pray for. However, I've never had a good shoot in a north wind and Saturday ran true to form. First, I chose the wrong blind. I had last choice and went to \#2. I should have forgotten about my recent experiences in \#1 and gone there; that pond wasn't frozen and ducks like it during a strong wind. Second, I shot poorly. I missed a number a shots and had trouble estimating range. My skeet shooter's constant lead technique works well in normal conditions but in a strong wind the birds give the illusion of standing still. For example, I missed three shots at a mallard that was 25 yards overhead; it had come to my widgeon call. I should always use the swing-through method on ducks flying into a strong wind. I did this once and got a sprig. I brought down two other birds but Daisy was unable to mark them because of the whitecaps on the pond. I went out to help her but had no idea where they had gone down. Also because of the glare, it was almost impossible to identify the ducks. I did hold off on a large flock of spoonies that came wing-set into the pond.

All in all, it was a frustrating and disappointing morning that convinced me I still have a lot to learn about duck hunting. On the positive side, I didn't get skunked and the scenery was beautiful, the morning so clear I felt I could touch the surrounding hills. Bag: 1 sprig.

Other: Al White had Friday's honors. He bagged 1 sprig and 3 mallards at \#5, and trapped a large rat in his truck.

Daisy still brings in one or two decoys while I'm setting them; I suppose she'll outgrow this puppy habit. In any event, enthusiasm is more easily restrained than instilled. She's been doing better about staying down and quiet in the blind but she was frustrated on Saturday with all the shots I missed.

Mike said that Cosby made a very long retrieve at \#7 but was out of sight for so long Mike worried he might be lost. After lunch, Mike took Cosby out to \#3 pond where Jim Jacobson had lost a mallard. Cosby searched a wide area for 10 minutes or so and found it.

I think a possible answer to the glare problem in a north wind is to rest the eyes for a while by facing away from the sun, into the wind. Be looking approximately where you would at skeet station high one. If a duck comes overhead in range there's still plenty of time to shoot it going away.

January 4th and 5th: This was a two-day shoot like last week's. Thursday afternoon was extremely hazy, with little wind. I drove up 680 and stopped at the Garabaldi reserve to eat my lunch and watch the geese. There were also many sprig in and over the Garabaldi ponds. At Sprig Farm, there were fewer birds than the past two weekends, but conditions were still promising. Late in the afternoon, large flocks of geese were working over the east side around Blinds \#12 and \#14.

On Friday morning I went to Blind 8. It was foggy going out, but the moon was visible. There was an unusual sense of peace and tranquility over the pond as I set out the decoys. Shortly after shooting time, the fog thickened so much that I could not see the opposite shore about 200 yards away. I went back to the clubhouse and read until about 10:30. By that time I could see the sun and decided go back out. By the time I reached the blind, the fog had lifted and the ducks started to move. I shot a sprig and a widgeon which fell in the pickleweed. Daisy had trouble marking them so I had to go out with her. Both birds were cripples and she caught them when they moved. She made a straightforward retrieve on a teal which fell in the pond. Bag: 1 sprig, 1 widgeon and 1 teal.

I went back to the blind around 3:30 and stayed until shortly before 5:00. There were ducks flying but none close enough to shoot. I did enjoy the afternoon sky and murky sunset.

The fog settled in on Friday night and I had doubts about Saturday. I took my time going out (again to Blind \#8) and was ready to shoot at 7:15. The fog wasn't that thick; I could see the telephone poles along the road, the dim outline of the clubhouse and Blind \#7. Enough ducks were flying to keep things interesting. I shot a large sprig and a teal. Both fell in the pond and Daisy marked them and made good retrieves. Because the sprig was shot early in the morning, I had to be careful about shooting at large ducks. I left the blind at 9:45 because I had to get back to the city, but by that time the action had slowed down and I don't think I missed much by leaving early. Bag: 1 sprig and 1 teal.

Other: On Friday Alan and Mitch White got 6 mallards, 2 sprig and 2 snow geese at \#14.

On Friday evening we had the traditional closing night steak dinner with Muriel's plum pudding for desert. Everybody, especially the new members, enjoyed the evening. Joe had not been well in recent weeks, but he made the effort to come out and say hello to everybody and to say goodbye on Saturday.

Running Total: Mallard -- 3

Sprig -- 6

Widgeon -- 19

Spoonie -- 7

Teal -- 2

Season Total -- 37

Reflections: For a number of reasons, this proved to be the best season in recent years. There were more ducks than in recent years and only on a few days was the shooting really slow.

The new members proved to be congenial companions and able duck hunters; they'll be even more effective when they've learned all the nuances of Sprig Farm's ponds.

Finally, there's no doubt that Daisy added a new level of enjoyment. She was an unfailing good companion on my walks[^1] and around the clubhouse and she got along well with the other members and dogs, particularly Cosby. Her demeanor in the blind was reasonably good. She would stay down and quiet if she had something to lie down on and I warned her when she started to move. She made routine retrieves routinely and a even few exceptional retrieves. However, she has not reached the point where she will consistently track down birds with her nose, the way Cosby does. I'm confident this will come with experience. Meanwhile, patience is the key.

[^1]: Except, of course, when she tangled with the otter.

May you all enjoy the off-season.
