*“It was the best of times; it was the worst of times.”*

Charles Dickens: A Tale of Two Cities

My off-season ranks among the best of times. I spent much of it traveling abroad, to Lourdes with the Order of Malta in late April, and in June, to Argentina with Jim Koeppen, Jim Jr., and George Couch for duck and dove. July and early August saw me hunting woodpigeon with John Batley in Herefordshire and visiting in-laws in Wales. In late August Jim Koeppen and I ventured to British Columbia for salmon and halibut. By summer’s end I’d accumulated a treasure trove of memories and a freezer full of fish.

Similarly, the summer might be considered one of St. Germain’s best times. Construction of our new club room began in July and to everyone’s delight, it was finished in time for duck season. With a panoramic view of the marsh, comfortable furniture, three flat video screens and of course a bar, this facility will surely be the envy of our neighboring duck clubs. Special appreciation is owed to Gary Cushman, who supervised the construction and to Pam Murphy, who created a décor that blends seamlessly with the marshland setting.

Meanwhile Jim Graziani was busy with the field work, overseeing measures intended to improve the flow of water over the property. New blinds were installed in \#3 pond and at the northwest corner of the house pond. The members voted to close the “Big Pond” to hunting so the ducks could use it as a resting area. This put blinds \#4 through \#7 off limits. Even though blind \#4 had been my favorite spot since I joined the club, I voted for the closure because I felt the experiment was worth tying.

**Saturday, October 24, 2009: Opening Day**

On Friday morning I took the 9:00 o’clock boat to the club. The day was warm and clear with a few scattered cirrus clouds and a light west wind. Warm weather was also forecast for Saturday. I spent the morning and early afternoon getting my boat and equipment ready and then took Ivy for a walk, but didn’t go very far because of the heat and the mosquitoes. I don’t recall seeing many ducks. Afterward I rested and read in my room until 6:00 o’clock, then joined the group for cocktails. I joined in toasting the occasion and exchanging wishes for good fortune, blissfully unaware that I was about to embark on my worst duck season ever.

Dinner was delayed until 8:15. There was barely room at the table for the nineteen hunters present. Abe Soto, our new cook, served an excellent meal. We started with green salad, then roast beef done in the Chinese smoker, baked asparagus and surprisingly, accompanied by a very tasty potato salad. For dessert he served an excellent strawberry sheet cake made from scratch. It was later than usual when I settled Ivy in her kennel and went to bed. The temperature was still mild.

The morning dawned clear and mild. I drew sixth choice and went to \#16 pond. The heavy cover that had obstructed visibility from the barrel last season was gone. I was ready to shoot a few minutes after starting time. The morning turned out to be most frustrating. After being blindsided several times by mallards I missed a crossing shot at a teal. At 7:30, I fired two rounds at a pair of mallards at 45 yards range. I hit the follower and it came down at the north edge of the pond, 117 yards distant, and disappeared into the tulles. I sent Ivy. She went into the area and started coursing around, occasionally disappearing into the heavy cover. Thinking she’d missed the mark, I waded over to where I’d seen the duck go in. I lost sight of Ivy for several minutes, then saw her about 80 yards to my right, carrying a large and still lively mallard. I tried to call her but she swam back to the island, arriving there while I was sloughing across the muddy pond. She held the duck for a while, but then let it go and it escaped. I was greatly disappointed. Ivy had made one of her best ever finds, but failed to complete the retrieve. (I recalled Stanford’s last minute loss to Arizona the previous Saturday.)

I had two more shooting opportunities but missed both times and left the pond at 9:15, with nothing to show for eight cartridges expended. I decided to stop by blind \#15 and see how Chris and Owen Charles were doing. Chris said that they’d done well but had lost a duck in the tulles near the boat ditch; it would be mine if Ivy found it. Sure enough, in a few minutes she emerged from the tulles with a hen gadwall. Chris said that another duck had fallen in the cover west of the blind. I sent Ivy over and she spent the next half hour hunting the entire area. I was tired and wanted to go in but Ivy kept hunting. I lost sight of her in the tulles and thought she might have fainted. At long last she came out and returned to the boat.

I went in, cleaned my duck plus a mallard that George Couch generously gave me, and was happy to put period to a very disappointing morning. Meanwhile, most of our other shooters enjoyed success, taking a total of seventy-five ducks, mostly mallards.

We had open face roast beef sandwiches for lunch, with garlic mashed potatoes covered with a tasty gravy. Ivy and I arrived home very tired.

Other: The shooters who stayed over on Saturday night did fairly well. On Sunday morning Chris doubled on mallards at blind \#21. The new blind, number \#30, was filled with water and unusable.

**Wednesday, October 28. 2009: The Penalty for Hardheadedness**

A fundamental rule of duck hunting on our marsh is that one must base his blind selection on the prevailing weather conditions rather than on a preconceived plan. On this hunt I paid the price for ignoring this principle.

Tuesday afternoon was cool, extremely windy and crystal clear, with strong north winds forecast to continue through the night and into the morning. Marc drove us to the dock. On the way I told Marc I had first pick and would take him to blind \#12. At 1:30 we made a slow and very rough crossing.

The cool weather and brilliant scenery made for an enjoyable walk with Ivy during which we saw quite a few ducks.

Our dinner featured baked and shredded pork shoulder that was nicely seasoned, along with Spanish rice, sautéed chard with garlic and a terrific chocolate pie for dessert.

On Wednesday morning Marc and I went out in my boat. In a strong wind the weight of a second person makes the boat easier to control. My experience that morning confirmed what I should have realized, namely blind \#12 is not a north wind blind. During the morning we watched many ducks flying into \#15 pond. That’s were we should have gone.

I made what might have been a spectacular shot on a mallard rocketing downwind at 60 mph. However, it fell in heavy tulles about 70 yards from the blind and Ivy was unable to find it, most likely because the wind had dissipated the scent. Marc shot a duck that the wind carried about 150 yards from his barrel at the point. I waded over to where it fell; Ivy spent a lot of time hunting it. She disappeared and I thought I’d lost her. Making my way back to the blind, I turned around and there she was, following me. Later I missed a shot at another duck and came in skunked again for three rounds fired.

We had very tasty pork sandwiches for lunch.

Other: a total of sixteen ducks were taken; Richard Vaccari has high Gun.

**Saturday, October 31, 2009: A Halloween Horror Show (My Shooting)**

I enjoyed this outing until I got out to the blind and couldn’t hit a thing. Friday afternoon was mild and hazy with a light breeze from the northwest. We crossed the river at three o’clock, an hour early, because of the tide. Harlan said there were some ducks on the property and when I took Ivy out for our customary walk I saw a dozen or so mallards get up from the area around \#1 pond.

Ten hunters sat down to the dinner table. We started with a green salad, then proceeded to a main course of Abe’s meat loaf and mashed potatoes covered with an excellent gravy, succotash and chocolate pie for dessert; all in all, a satisfying “comfort food” dinner.

The sky was clear when I settled Ivy down for the night but next morning to my surprise, a light fog covered the marsh. This is the earliest I’ve ever experienced ground fog. The wind had shifted to the southwest and was blowing at 5 mph. During the morning the fog hung over the river and covered the western hills; occasionally patches of fog drifted over the club. However the fog was no problem. The problem is that somewhere between the dock and the inner island at blind \#12[^1] my shooting ability must have jumped out of the boat. Result, I fired nine rounds at five possible targets without result except, unfortunately, hitting one duck that came down 170 yards toward blind \#13. Ivy and I went out after it but she could not find it. Admittedly, on this my third unsuccessful venture out on the marsh I may have been pressing. I resolved to persevere and not get too upset.

[^1]: Also called “Bandit’s Island”, after Jim Graziani’s beloved Brittany spaniel. Bandit died on July 4, 2001. In September of that year, after the ponds were flooded, Jim, Mike Corsetti and I took a cedar box containing Bandit’s ashes out to the island. Jim and Mike dug a fairly deep hole, Jim placed the box at the bottom, and the three of us stood in a circle. Jim had brought a flask of Scotch and three glasses. We drank a toast to Bandit and each of us recalled our memories of him. After our stories were told (and a tear or two shed), Jim poured a few drops of whiskey on the box, then each of us took a handful of sod and dropped it on top. Then the grave was filled in. All the while flights of ducks were circling in the distance, lending a feeling of completeness to the ceremony.

We had meat loaf sandwiches for lunch.

Andy Stone’s three mallards at blind \#21 made him the star of the day. Three other good ducks were taken. Tim Murphy gave me a teal and I didn’t go home empty handed.

**Wednesday, November 4, 2009: A Change for the Better**

Tuesday afternoon’s warm and calm weather was not promising. We crossed the river at the normal time, 4:00 p.m. I took Ivy for a walk along the levee road but saw only a few ducks in the far distance.

After a pleasant cocktail hour in the clubroom, dinner commenced at 7:00 o’clock. Our green salad was dressed with Marc Pasquini’s home-made vinegar, the main course was New York strip steaks, done to each diner’s preference, baked potatoes, sautéed chard and a light meringue for dessert. I contributed a bottle of 2004 Villa Antonori “Toscana” that was well received.

I arose at 4:00 a.m. (we were back on Standard Time). When I went out to rouse Ivy, I was delighted to feel a cool fresh wind blowing out of the west. A meteor flashed across the sky. I went to Bandit’s Island, the scene of my two previous failures, this time with a feeling of confidence that events would vindicate. Shortly before sunrise, I observed a large duck crossing from the northwest and well within range. I stood up, mounted the gun, saw the correct lead, fired and watched the duck fall in the pond about 25 yards to the southwest. It lay still in the water as Ivy swam out go get it. When she brought it to hand, her expression seemed to tell me, “Now that’s more like it.” The duck turned out to be a ring neck but when I cleaned it, I could tell it had been feeding on rice and grain in the Valley and would be good eating.

The rest of the morning was very quiet. Once again a thin blanket of fog covered the western hills; the wind shifted from the southwest to the northwest for a while and then shifted back. I spent this time reviewing my previous performances. Recalling my high school geometry[^2] and using the range finder to measure a number of distances, I concluded that on the previous hunts, I’d been shooting at ducks that were out of range. Jim Graziani, who was in blind \#15 at the far end of the pond, bagged a gadwall. These two ducks were the only ones taken this day.

[^2]: To be precise, the Pythagorean Theorem: the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

We had very large portions of home-made lasagna for lunch.

Bag: one ring neck for one cartridge.

**Saturday, November 7, 2009: More Frustration**

On Friday afternoon the sky was overcast with mid-level clouds as a brisk wind blew from the southwest and in the evening a weak weather front passed over the Bay Area bringing light rain. Harlan said there were “a few” ducks on the property. Thanks to the clouds, the sunset was the prettiest we’d observed this season. I walked out the gate with Ivy and saw a few small flights of duck in the distance.

Dinner was a special treat, the high point of my hunt. Jim Koeppen contributed two sides of Chinook salmon from our trip in August. Abe baked the salmon with a covering of oriental black bean and garlic sauce plus chopped onion and plenty of lemon juice, and accompanied it with asparagus, white and wild rice and Hollandaise sauce. (I had a second helping of salmon). Dessert was a chocolate mousse cake made from scratch.

On Wednesday morning the wind was still blowing briskly out of the west. When I went out to rouse Ivy the sky was overcast but it cleared during breakfast and we ventured out to the blinds under the stars. I went to blind \#16, not the wisest choice because during the off-season the pond bottom had been plowed and it was difficult to move around in the mud. Also the water level was higher than usual, thus reducing the usable area of the island and requiring Ivy to stand with her feet in the water.

The morning was very clear and the scenery stood out in bold relief. There were only a few high ducks to be seen. Around 8:00 o’clock a solitary drake mallard circled the island and set its wings, most likely intending to land outside my decoys, which were set about 20 yards northwest of the island. I stood up, fired a shot and missed. As the duck climbed away, I pointed the gun directly at it and fired again. The duck leveled off and came down near the tulles far edge of the pond. Ivy marked the fall and went directly to the spot, but neither of us saw it again. She scoured the area for ten minutes or so but failed to find it. I picked up and went in, disappointed to have lost yet another duck.

Others did better. Corey Abel and Andy Stone shot at blind \#8; Corey bagged five mallards and Andy, two widgeon and two gadwall. Jim Koeppen bagged a mallard and a pintail at \#12 and Chris Charles got a cinnamon teal at blind \#28.

We had linguini with pesto sauce for lunch and left the club at 1:30.

**Saturday, November 14, 2009: They Know Where They’re Safe**

I stayed home on Tuesday for Muriel’s birthday party. On Wednesday afternoon went out to Pacific Rod & Gun Club and shot four rounds of skeet to bolster my confidence. Friday afternoon’s weather was ideal, with a cool west wind and a scattering of mid-level clouds across the sky. We crossed the river at 1:30 and had plenty of time for a leisurely walk out past the gate. Jim Graziani came along. We observed several flights of ducks going into the area between \#1 and \#3 ponds.

Our dinner commenced with lettuce and tomato salad topped with slices of smoked duck, courtesy of Andy Stone; the main course was roast turkey, dressing, baked sweet potatoes, mashed white potatoes and gravy, with the customary cranberry sauce and for dessert, a tasty sweet potato pie.

Saturday morning was partly cloudy with a southwest wind. I had a fairly low blind pick but \#12 was still open and I invited Jim Graziani to join me. While we were having breakfast the wind shifted to the east. The waning crescent moon shone brightly.

The morning continued cool with unlimited horizontal visibility, conditions showing the marsh at it best and making it a joy simply to be there. There were few ducks flying, all of them came over us at least 65 yards high before dropping into the open area halfway between us and \#15 pond. I fired one cartridge at a duck I told Jim was probably a little too high." He replied, "It was way too high!" Around 9:00 o’clock, when Chad Lyon fired three shots from blind \#16, dozens of ducks got up and circled around several times before dropping back into the open area. These were obviously local birds who knew where they would be safe. We would need migratory birds for the hunting to improve. The morning’s greatest excitement came when five trumpeter swans flew over my head at 20 yards.

Other hunters fared equally poorly, except for Corey Abel, who bagged a mallard at blind \#16. Steve Martinelli got the only other duck of the morning at blind \#28, a hen merganser. We had large turkey sandwiches for lunch.

**Wednesday, November 18, 2009: One More Quiet Morning**

Tuesday dawned clear, but in the afternoon a line of clouds appeared in the northwest. By late afternoon, rain was falling on the Napa hills. I gave Ivy a hurried walk during which we saw only a few ducks in the distance, then I dressed her in her neoprene jacket, prepared my equipment and afterward spent the cocktail hour in the clubroom watching basketball on our big screen.

Dinner was outstanding; several members said it was the best of the season. It featured perfectly barbecued rack of lamb, broccoli with cheddar cheese sauce, garlic roasted potatoes and a chocolate sundae for dessert. I contributed two bottles of 2005 Cambria “Julia’s Vineyard” Pinot Noir that went well with the lamb.

Light rain fell during the night. At 4:30, when I went out to wake Ivy, the front had passed and the stars were shining brilliantly. I went to blind \#3 and liked the layout of the pond. Early on, I missed two shots at what most likely a diving duck. Later two mallards came out of the sun and flew overhead. By the time I concluded that they might be in range, they weren’t, so I held fire. I observed a few ducks going into the high ground east of blind \#4, part of our new resting area. For the first time in the season there were many geese in the air giving me hope that new migratory birds would soon be arriving.

Marc Pasquini was high Gun with a widgeon and a spoonie at blind \#8 and Richard

Vaccari bagged a hen mallard at blind \#26. After an early lunch of tri-tip sandwiches and brownies made from scratch we left the club at 12:35.

**Saturday, November 22, 2009: Party Time**

We crossed the river shortly after 11:00 o’clock on Friday morning in order to get the club ready to host the annual Marsh Party. At this time a cold front was bringing strong winds and rain to the Bay Area; we hoped it would pass by evening and fortunately, it did. During the afternoon we moved extra tables into the dining room, set up bars at the entrance to the club, in the plucking area and in the our new clubroom and attended to the many other necessary details. Abe our chef, who had arrived a day earlier, proudly showed us a huge cake he had made from scratch. Covered with green frosting it featured an authentically colored pastry mallard peeking over one edge.

About fifty hunters from our neighboring clubs arrived at 6:00 o’clock. We welcomed them with drinks of their choice and appetizers consisting of iced prawns, chicken wings with Cajun sauce and Taquitos. For dinner we served barbequed tri-tip, Caesar salad and chili. The mallard cake was a big hit, and the guests were mightily impressed with our new clubroom. Our neighbors departed at 9:00 p.m. but some of our members decided that the party was too good to end so they extended it into the wee hours.

The night was cold so I made suitable provisions for Ivy. When we went out at 4:30 the next morning, the sky was clear with a scattering of high clouds and a brisk wind was blowing from the west-southwest. I picked blind \#12 and invited George Couch to come along and hunt in the outer blind. Shortly after shooting time, he fired two shots at a diving duck without result. A few minutes later I did likewise.

The morning was cool, clear and the scenery was pretty, but the ducks were few and far between. The only excitement came when two flights of pintail circled our blinds at seventy yards, safely out of range. We went in at 9:15. Abe made generous sandwiches from the left over tri-tip and we had the party cake for dessert; there was enough left for me to take home a big piece.

**Tuesday and Wednesday, November 24-25, 2009: The Disappearing Act**

There were five of us at the club for this hunt, Marc, Jim Koeppen, Corey Abel, his guest Brian Flaherty and I. At 11:00 o’clock on Tuesday we left the *St. Germain* in her dock at McAvoy and crossed the river in Brian’s boat. The weather was warm, clear but slightly hazy with light and variable wind. Under our rules, Corey, a Saturday season shooter, was deemed a guest on any Wednesday shoot and he could only hunt with a member or a regular Wednesday shooter. Accordingly, when we set out after lunch for an afternoon hunt, I took Brian with me and Corey went with Marc. I picked blind \#26; when we arrived at the pond, at least fifty large ducks flew off. However, the afternoon was extremely quiet; only one pair of mallards flew by no closer than eighty yards. Marc and Corey had a similar experience at blind \#8. Jim Koeppen, who went to blind \#12, reported that a widgeon landed in his decoys. He let it fly off. He had seen quite a few ducks in \#15 pond and recommended that we go there in the morning.

Because of the small number at the club, Abe was given time off and Harlan prepared the dinner, a pleasant lettuce and avocado salad to start, a hearty pot roast with potatoes and vegetables for the main course, and left over party cake for dessert. Cold nighttime temperatures were forecast so I took appropriate steps to assure Ivy’s comfort.

Wednesday morning was clear and hazy with light and variable winds. After a hurried stop at blind \#26 to retrieve decoys and the other gear we’d left there, Brian and I went to out blind \#15. No ducks got up when we entered the pond and the morning was extremely quiet. Only a pair of teal came by the blind but I let them pass because I didn’t want to shoot over Ivy. We went in at 9:00 o’clock.

Marc and Corey went back to blind \#8 and stayed there until 11:15. They returned with three mallards and Marc singing the praises of Corey’s calling. Apparently the ducks that flew of the previous afternoon didn’t start returning until late in the morning.

Because of the tide, we had a hurried lunch of chicken pot pie and left the club at 12:30.

**Wednesday, December 2, 2009: A Duck Brought In and Another Lost**

Tuesday’s weather was typical for late fall, mild temperature, winter haze, scattered high clouds and virtually no wind. We crossed the mirror smooth river at 2:30. Harlan reported that there were some ducks on the property but I didn’t see any when Ivy and I walked out to the gate.

Following a salad with red onion, croutons and anchovies, we dined on roast pork loin with mashed potatoes and sautéed chard. Abe made separate gravies for the meat and the potatoes; he served chocolate sundaes for dessert. Near freezing temperatures were forecast so I brought Ivy inside.

The full moon was shining brightly at 5:00 a.m. but there were patches of high fog and a brisk west wind. I had a low pick and went to blind \#3. The sky was overcast with high fog and the wind was cold. For most of the morning the sky was empty, except for the occasional diving ducks. The morning’s most exciting moment came when four trumpeter swans flew over the boat ditch at 30 yards. Around 8:00 o’clock a duck came into my decoys and I brought it down with one shot, an easy retrieve for Ivy. From its white wing bars I thought it was a widgeon but it turned out to be large hen bluebill, an edible duck that I happily put on my strap. I was far less pleased later when I hit a mallard that was flying overhead. The bushes by the blind prevented me from marking its fall. Ivy went out in the general direction and scoured the whole area for twenty minutes but she failed to find it.

At 9:15 I went in chilled, tired and disappointed at having lost another duck. We had linguini and clams for lunch. Steve Martinelli shot three diving ducks at blind \#26.

**Saturday, December 5, 2009: Visual and Gustatory Treats**

The forecast called for a series of storms commencing on Sunday but on Friday afternoon the stagnant late autumn weather regime was still in place. At 4:00 o’clock, when we crossed the river, it was dead calm. The sun was shining weakly though the haze and high clouds and its reflection off the mirror-flat water made the scene like a Turner painting brought to life. I took a twilight walk with Ivy but saw no ducks.

Dinner was delightful, roast leg of lamb, roast potatoes, yams, Brussels sprouts roasted with caraway seeds and bananas Foster for dessert.

Afterwards I brought Ivy inside, took a hot shower and settled down for the night. At 5:00 a.m., when we went out, I was surprised to see that the haze had been blown away by the wind, which was blowing cold and fairly hard out of the west. The sky was covered with mid-level clouds.

I had a low pick and went to blind \#26. During the morning there were quite a few diving ducks in the pond. Shortly after sunrise, three ducks flew out of the sun and passed overhead. I called them back but missed two shots at them. Later I saw large flocks of what looked like teal going into \#23 pond. Once again I came in empty-handed, my cartridge bag lighter by two

George Couch shot a diving duck at blind \#8 and Andy Stone shot two of them at blind \#12. The star of the morning was Andy’s dog Skoal. He found and retrieved a mallard that Jim Koeppen had shot from the helicopter pad. Jim had stayed in to rest his back.

We had delicious lamb curry for lunch followed by pound cake with ice cream and chocolate sauce.

**Wednesday, December 9, 2009: Blindsided**

On Sunday an Arctic cold front passed though the Bay Area and in its wake temperatures dropped to freezing levels. On Tuesday Mount Diablo and the surrounding hills were covered with snow. The afternoon was partly cloudy, hazy, almost dead calm and very cold. We crossed the river at 4:00 o’clock. Harlan said there were ducks on the property but I didn’t see any when I took Ivy for a walk made shorter than usual because of the cold. I brought her inside during the cocktail hour.

Our dinner featured corned beef with boiled potatoes carrots and sautéed mushrooms and tiramisu for dessert. John gave me three large bottles of his home-made English style ale; the members said it was excellent.

On Wednesday morning the walkways were covered with icicles but the ponds were not frozen. The wind, still very cold, was blowing from the northeast, making blind \#13 a good choice. During the first hour there was very little action. At one time a dozen or so widgeon came to my call, circled overhead several times 100 yards high, and then flew off. Later, while I was looking the other way, a large flock of ducks passed directly overhead well within range. I was amazed at the sight and failed to react in time. Shortly after 8:00 o’clock, I saw large flocks of ducks flying around the area, back and forth, up and down, just like teal. I called and one flock of about twenty came my way. I focused on a duck, fired and brought it down about 20 yards from the blind, an easy retrieve for Ivy. However, it turned out to be a bluebill, not a teal. At 8:40 I picked up and came in. Gary Cushman bagged a widgeon at blind \#26 and Marc, a spoonie at \#15. Les Vaccari, Lou Flanders and Mike Corsetti were skunked.

Because of the tide, we ate a hurried lunch of corned beef sandwiches at left the club at 11:30. Steve Martinelli was high Gun. He hid in the reeds at \#17 pond and bagged a mallard, a gadwall, a spoonie, three diving ducks and a coot.

I arrived home very tired and chilled and decided that I needed a break, so I skipped the Saturday hunt. That day I went out to Pacific Rod & Gun Club and had a good time shooting trap.

**Wednesday, December 16, 2009: A Gloomy Winter Morn**

The results of this hunt were as dreary as the grey winter overcast. Our 2:00 o’clock crossing made it possible to take a long and leisurely walk with Ivy under the leaden sky. There was no wind. We saw a great many diving ducks but only three quarry ducks in the far distance

Our dinner featured veal scaloppini done with flour, egg and breadcrumbs, peas and carrots, mashed potatoes and pound cake and ice cream. I contributed two bottles of 2005 Chateau Sainte Marie Medoc that everyone seemed to enjoy.

The night was not very cold so Ivy slept outside dressed in her neoprene jacket. When I first went out in the morning there was high fog and only the slightest hint of a breeze from the east. At breakfast I picked blind \#1 but when I stepped outside the wind had shifted to the north, so I went back and changed my selection to blind \#15. I reached the pond half hour after shooting time but it didn’t matter. There were flocks of diving ducks over and around me for the next two hours. I fired two rounds at what I hoped was a teal but was likely a diving duck. I missed. I went in around 9:30.

Of the nine members at the club, only six went out in the morning and they might as well have stayed in. For the first time in recent memory, the club was totally, completely and utterly skunked.

We had jumbo hot dogs and chili beans for lunch and left the club at 1:00 p.m.

**Saturday, December 19, 2009: Joy in the Morning**

On Friday afternoon the sky over the City was bright and clear and the temperature mild, but at McAvoy harbor the air was cold and damp, visibility was obscured by heavy winter haze and a bank of dense fog hung over the northern end of the marsh. Ivy and I were joined by Steve Martinelli on our walk out to the gate. We saw two or three pairs of mallard. The prospect of dense ground fog in the morning didn’t disturb me; the shortage of ducks plus my poor results to this point in the season had sapped my zeal for the hunt and I felt that I’d just as soon sleep in on Saturday morning.

We dined on fillet mignon baked in a crust, asparagus, baked potatoes with bananas Foster for dessert. Dinner was later than usual and I didn’t get to bed until almost 10:00 o’clock.

The high cloud cover prevented ground fog from forming during the night and in the morning there was a layer of fog at 1,000 feet; horizontal visibility extended to three miles. I had third choice. The brisk northeast wind made blind \#15 a logical choice and I invited Jim Graziani to come along with me. We went out in my boat.

There were still so many sea ducks flying around that Jim and I had trouble recognizing the occasional teal that came by. It looked to be a repeat of Wednesday until a pair of mallard crossed over the boat ditch at about 45 yards. I focused on one, gave it what looked like enough lead, pressed the trigger and watched it tumble into the pond. I released Ivy and as she swam towards the duck, it made its way into the reeds by the boat ditch. Ivy had marked the spot but initially failed to find the duck. For ten minutes or so she swam around the area, then returned to the entry point, fifty-eight yards from the blind, and disappeared into the reeds. I heard some splashing; then she emerged with something in her mouth and started back to the blind. When I put the field glasses on her I could scarcely believe my eyes. She was carrying a hen mallard that she brought directly to hand. I put the duck on my strap while lavishing praise on her and then enjoyed a small celebratory libation that Jim handed me. At long last the drought was over. My enthusiasm returned.

I happily spent the rest of the morning watching the sea ducks and went in at 10:00 o’clock. Some of the others did well. Jim Koeppen and Jim Jr. got five ducks and a small goose at blind \#12, Jared Cushman, a fine drake mallard at \#26A which he generously gave me, Steve Martinelli, a mallard and two spoonies in the reeds behind blind \#17 and Mike Powell and his guest Dave four ducks at blind \#8. George Couch got skunked at blind \#3.

For lunch we had spaghetti with a sauce made from deer sausage with raspberry cake for dessert.

**Wednesday, December 23, 2009: Pre-Christmas Cheer**

Tuesday afternoon was cold and so crystal clear that from the crest of highway \#4 we could see the outline of the Sierra Mountains. A brisk northwest wind made the crossing fairly rough. After we arrived, I had to spend some time untangling the camouflage net that I use to cover my boat and the sun had set when I took Ivy for our customary walk. I didn’t see any ducks.

Our dinner of ham, twice baked yams and sautéed red Swiss chard, with pound cake and ice cream for dessert, featured a wine tasting. By way of background, some members, myself included, had voiced dissatisfaction with the club wine, a Lodi Zinfandel, alcohol level 14.5 percent. In response, our President challenged me to find better wine that was reasonably priced. I picked out two bottles from my cellar, a Gamay from the south of France and a Cabernet-Merlot blend under the Costco label. I also bought a 2007 Sonoma County Merlot from Firefly Ridge that Safeway was selling for under \$6.00. The eight members present weren’t particularly impressed with the Gamay, but they liked the Costco blend and they thought the Firefly Ridge was a very good value. As senior officer present, I directed Harlan to buy two cases of the Costco wine and one case of Firefly Ridge. In the same capacity, I suspended the “no dogs in your room” rule because the nighttime temperature was forecast to fall near freezing.

Wednesday morning dawned cold and clear, but the wind had shifted to the west. I picked blind \#15 and invited Marc to come along. I was expecting the wind to shift to the north, as had been forecast but it kept blowing from the west all morning. The wind direction didn’t make any difference because so few ducks were flying. Marc missed three shots at a pair of mallards that came out of the sun. After spending the morning chatting with Marc and watching the diving ducks, I brought all my cartridges back to the dock.

There was more excitement at some other ponds. Mike Corsetti bagged a pintail and three widgeon at blind \#12. At blind \#10, Jim Koeppen fell head first into one of the barrels and was so firmly wedged in that Frank Fiala, Jim’s partner, had to struggle for fifteen minutes to extricate him. Later that morning, Frank bagged a widgeon, a fitting reward for his Herculean efforts. Everyone else was skunked.

After a lunch of Tuscan bean and tuna salad, the low tide kept us at the club until 3:45. We spent the time relaxing on the porch of the clubroom enjoying the sunshine and the scenery and we even saw a pair of mallards on the house pond.

**Wednesday, December 30, 2009: An Opportunity Seized**

Tuesday afternoon was dead calm and the sky was covered with a layer of dark clouds as another in a series of weak storm fronts passed over northern California. We crossed the river at 2:00 o’clock. I took an hour’s walk with Ivy and saw a few ducks flying over the property. I was walking back to the clubhouse after kenneling Ivy when I looked to the northeast and saw hundreds of ducks getting up from the state reserve about a mile or two distant. So, there *were* ducks on the marsh after all.

The cocktail hour was spent in the clubroom watching football. We sat down to dinner at 6:15, earlier than usual. The menu was green salad, meatloaf, mashed potatoes with gravy, peas and carrots and dessert, banana slices heated in rum and served over mocha and chocolate ice cream.

Nighttime temperatures were forecast to remain well above freezing so I dressed Ivy in her neoprene jacket and let her sleep in her kennel. Some rain fell during the night. At 5:15 a.m. I went out to rouse her. The sky was still overcast with cloud cover at 4,000 feet and there was no wind.

I invited Marc to come along with me to blind \#8. A number of big ducks got up as we entered the boat ditch. The morning was so dark that I was initially disoriented but I recovered my bearings as the sky lightened and the familiar line of telephone poles and the lights at Rich Island came into view. Our first hour and a half were the quietest time of the season; hardly anything was flying. A hen mallard came overheat at 65-70 yards but I realized that there was little chance of hitting it hard enough so I held fire. I also held fire when a flock of teal flew by only a few feet above the water because I didn’t want to shoot over Ivy. My luck changed at 9:00 o’clock when I spied a flock of teal about 300 yards to the south. I started calling and they turned directly toward us. As they passed about 30 yards in front of us, I focused on one, fired and hit it solidly. Ivy made an easy retrieve. I probably should have tried for a double and certainly should have alerted Marc, who was looking in the other direction, but I was delighted to have a duck on my strap

We went in at 10:00 o’clock. Abe greeted us with freshly made split pea and ham soup and later we had meatloaf sandwiches for lunch. Mike Corsetti bagged a pintail at blind \#15 and Les Vaccari, a widgeon at \#12.

**Wednesday, January 6, 2010: An Opportunity Wasted**

We crossed the river at 4:00 o’clock, the sky covered with high clouds and further darkened by a layer of fog at 500 feet. A cold wind out of the east intensified the gloom; this was truly the dead of winter. I took Ivy for a short walk, saw only one pair of mallard and turned back because of the cold. Dinner was more cheerful: southern fried chicken, kernel corn with southwest sauce, mashed potatoes and gravy, pound cake, ice cream with chocolate sauce for dessert. Needless to say, Ivy slept inside.

The morning’s weather was as dismal as the previous afternoon. I had last blind choice and went to blind \#26A to take advantage of the east wind. Apart from the diving ducks very little was flying. I called in a mallard but missed two shots at it, probably because I fired too soon. Later I missed two shots at a teal at extreme range. I stayed out until 10:00 o’clock and then visited Marc at blind \#8. He also was blanked. The scene was happier at blind \#10, where Les Vaccari and Lou Flanders bagged a mallard and two gadwall. To Lou’s delight, his new dog, a nine-month old black Labrador named Ruckus¸ retrieved both ducks.

Chris and Owen Charles had an outstanding morning at blind \#12, bringing in two geese, two pintail, three teal and a spoonie. Chris said they would have been even more successful had they been shooting better during the first hour.

We had pastrami sandwiches and some leftover chicken for lunch. Because of the tide, we stayed at the club until 4:30.

**Saturday, January 9, 2009: A Brilliant Plan Goes Nowhere\*\*\***

We crossed the river at noon on Friday because of the unusual tides and had lunch at the club: cold meats, cheeses, French bread and some smoked salmon from my fishing trip in August. The salmon was very well received.

The weather was a reprise of Wednesday, fog at 500 feet with about one mile horizontal visibility, an overcast of high clouds at a bitterly cold wind blowing out of the east, one more gloomy winter day. Ivy and I went out after lunch for an hour’s walk and I was cheered to see more ducks on the property than I’d seen all season. This confirmed my plan: to pick blind \#12 (where Chris and Owen had enjoyed success on Wednesday) and invite George Couch to join me. The weather conditions were identical, there were ducks on the property and I was confident that George and I would finally break out of our season-long slump.

After cocktails in the clubroom, we sat down to dinner featuring New York steaks so large that I saved half to take home the next day, baked potatoes, sautéed broccoli and a freshly made white cake with chocolate frosting. The evening air was cold and damp and although freezing temperatures were not anticipated, I thought it prudent to bring Ivy into my room. We both slept very well. When I finished breakfast, I summoned Ivy, got into my boat, sped out to blind \#12 and set up on the inner island. I didn’t want to waste a minute of what was going to be *my* morning. It wasn’t long before George and his Labrador Buster arrived and took the outer island.

A few minutes later a small duck raced by. I wasn’t certain it was a teal but I fired two rounds at it and watched it fly on before coming down on the water about 150 yards south of the blind. Ivy went out, followed by Buster; the two dogs searched the area but didn’t find anything. After that, our morning consisted of watching ducks fly around our blinds while keeping well out of range. I fired two desperation two-shot volleys at mallards that were about 75 yards away with predictable results.

Because the tide required an early departure, we picked up at 9:00 o’clock. The morning was equally dismal for most of the other hunters with a “grand” total of three teal for the morning. We ate a hurried lunch of linguini and clams and left the club at noon.

**Wednesday, January 13, 2010: Ivy Gets Some Work**

On Monday evening I cooked one half of the mallard I’d bagged on the 19th of December; the first bite reminded me of one reason why I’m a duck hunter. On Tuesday the weather was definitely changing; the dreary winter haze was gone thanks to a brisk southwest wind, the temperature was mild and the scenery was clearly visible under a cover of clouds at 5,000 feet.

We crossed the river at 2:00 o’clock. Some of the fellows went out hunting. I used the time to take a long walk with Ivy, made more enjoyable by the scenery, the sight of a few ducks and some old Jack Benny radio shows that I listened to on my new I-Pod.

Dinner was unusual, tripe Caribbean style over rice, green peas and pound cake with whipped cream and fruit for dessert. We sampled a few wines, the favorite was a 2005 Merlot from Chateau St. Michelle in Washington.

Some rain fell during the night but the mild temperature allowed Ivy to sleep *al fresco*. When I went out to rouse her at 5:00 a.m. the sky was clear with a scattering of mid-level clouds and a brisk wind was blowing out the southwest. I had a middling blind and invited Marc to join me at blind \#10. At shooting time the sky was overcast with rain clouds but the sunrise was spectacular.

There was virtually nothing flying during the first hour but shortly after 8:00 o’clock a pair of teal raced by. As they were going away Marc hit one and it came down in the pond about 25 yards away. As Ivy was going out for it, a pair of widgeon circled down toward our decoys. Marc brought down the drake about 15 yards on my side of the island. I missed an off-balance shot at the hen. Ivy turned around, retrieved the drake, brought it to hand and then went back and got the teal. That was the sum total of our action although I did fire two desperation volleys at distant mallards, with predictable results. About 9:00 o’clock rain began falling and it continued for half an hour. After it stopped we were treated to the sight of a rainbow in the northwest. Later in the morning the sky cleared, the temperature warmed and the air was delightfully fresh, making me feel that the dead of winter was finally behind us.

A total of six ducks were taken by our nine hunters. After a lunch of large (half-pound) hamburgers we left the club at 1:00 o’clock.

**Saturday, January 16, 2010: Success in the Mist**

On Friday afternoon the mix of fog and winter haze had returned to the marsh but the cover of high clouds lent credence to the forecast that a series of powerful storms was heading our way. We crossed the river at 4:00 o’clock. A brisk northeast wind was blowing when I took Ivy out for a walk in the fading light. We walked the half-mile to the gate and I saw a few mallards in the area of \#1 pond.

Harlan and Abe collaborated on our annual cioppino dinner; the nineteen members and guests heartily enjoyed it and when they finished there was only one crab claw left over. Abe served scratch-made brownies for dessert. The evening air was not particularly cold so I dressed Ivy in her neoprene coat and let her sleep outside.

The fog grew denser during the night and when I went out at 5:00 a.m., I could barely make out the lights at Rich Island, about a mile away. I picked blind \#1 but waited until it was light before going out. At least two dozen ducks flew off when I entered the pond. I was ready to shoot at 7:55. Visibility was about half a mile but very few ducks were flying and nothing came within range. Things changed for the better at 9:15 when I spied a pair of ducks in the distance. When I blew the widgeon call they circled and came over within range. I picked out one, fired and watched it drop in the pond about eighteen yards from the blind. Ivy made an easy retrieve. A few minutes later a bank of dense tulle fog blew in from the north, cutting visibility to less than 200 yards. I waited about half an hour for it to lift, and then decided to go in. As I putting my gun in the case, two mallards flew overhead well within range, typical of my luck this season. In any event I was happy to have a duck on my strap.

We had tortellini with some of the leftover cioppino sauce. Corey Abel and Andy Stone came in from blind \#21 with two mallards, two widgeon and two teal. They barbecued the mallards and shared them with us. Jim Koeppen Jr. bagged four teal at blind \#12.

**Wednesday, January 27, 2010: My Concluding Hunt**

A powerful storm with gale force winds struck the Bay Area on Tuesday, January 19. The danger of attempting to cross the river in these conditions prompted our president Tim Murphy to cancel the hunt, in my opinion a prudent decision. I also missed the pleasures of the Saturday hunt for the greater pleasure of hosting John Batley, who spent the weekend with me before returning home to Herefordshire after attending the gun trade show in Las Vegas.

It rained hard on Sunday and Monday. A few drops were still falling on Tuesday morning when Ivy and I rode with Marc and his guest Paul Holland to McAvoy for a 12:30 crossing. At the time I wasn’t aware that this would be the final hunt of the season for Ivy and me because a cold would keep me at home on the weekend.

When we arrived at the club, Harlan reported that there were very few ducks on the property, not surprising because heavy rains usually chase the ducks off the marsh. I took a long walk with Ivy under a still cloudy sky; a cold wind was blowing out of the northeast. Thanks to my field glasses I was able to see, at a considerable distance, two small flocks of ducks in the air. And there was very little other bird life on the marsh.

Dinner was a standout: perfectly poached Chinook salmon that Jim Koeppen had caught on our fishing trip with a sour cream and horseradish sauce, steamed rice, sautéed green beans and homemade brownies with ice cream for dessert. The magnum of champagne that Paul contributed went very well with the meal.

I’d left my weather radio at home and unsure as to how low the nighttime temperature might fall, gave Ivy the benefit of the doubt and brought her into my room.

On Wednesday morning the sky remained overcast but the wind shifted to the southwest. I went back to blind \#1 and experienced one of the quietest mornings of the season. As I was entering the pond, I observed a pair of mallards about 300 yards high, partially obscured in the mist. Later that morning another pair landed about 150 yards northwest of the blind. Otherwise there was nothing; even the sea ducks were few and far between. The weather was somewhat unusual in that while there was high fog over the marsh, the surrounding hills, to the north and west were bathed in sunshine, their new grass a verdant green.

I picked up at 9:00 o’clock and took a ride out to blind \#12 on the chance that Marc and Paul might need some dog work. They didn’t. Marc hadn’t fired and Paul, who was in the barrel on Bandit’s Island, had shot two diving ducks; this would make him high Gun for the morning.

We had spaghetti and meat sauce for lunch.

**Postscript**

As mentioned, I missed the final Saturday hunt. Thus it seems fitting that on Wednesday as I was cruising along Noyce Slough on my way back to the dock, the overcast cleared and the sun came out. I cut my speed and looked around to take in the marsh and the scenery, saying to myself, “how truly fortunate I am to be out here.”

My duck season had turned out to be my least successful ever. The statistics speak for themselves: six ducks (one mallard, one teal, one widgeon, one ring neck and two bluebills) for forty-nine cartridges. Ever more disappointing was the failure to recover six downed birds. Nevertheless, simply being on the marsh was always pleasurable and made every trip to the club feel worthwhile.

May all of you enjoy the summer months as we hope for better things next season.
