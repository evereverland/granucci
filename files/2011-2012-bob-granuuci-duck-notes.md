**Introduction, or The Best Laid Plans . . .**

In April the members elected me president of our club. This meant my summer would be busy for in addition to my annual sojourn to England, a fishing trip to Alaska and several skeet shooting events, I would be spending considerable time at the club. Alas, it was not to be. In June, while fishing in Alaska, my right knee collapsed requiring me to undergo a partial knee replacement in late July. Fortunately, during my slow, at times agonizingly slow, recuperation, the necessary work at the club went forward thanks to the splendid cooperation of our membership. During this time I wondered whether I’d have sufficient strength and mobility to go hunting but I was determined to be at the club to preside at the pre-Opening Day dinner. On a Friday in early October I went to the club for the preseason meeting. The following morning Andy Stone helped me into his boat and gave me hour’s ride around our ponds. The experience of being out on the marsh and seeing all the ducks on our property raised my spirits and strengthened my resolution to go out on Opening Day.

**Saturday October 22, 2011: Joy Clouded**

On the morning of Thursday, October 20th, I set out for the club under a high fog that covered the City and reached nearly to Oakland. We crossed the river at noon under a clear sky with a west wind strong enough to raise a few whitecaps on the river. Harlan reported that there were more ducks on the property than had been there in years. We made our own sandwiches and then set to work preparing our boats. I can’t speak highly enough about Jared and Erik Cushman. They hauled my boat into the boat works, gave it a thorough power washing (it hadn’t been covered during the summer) and then installed my motor. I was able to get into and out of the boat on my own and give it a short and successful test run. Later I walked Ivy out to the curve in the road (I hadn’t regained enough endurance to make it all the way to the gate) and observed twenty or so mallards sunning themselves. We had an early dinner, green salad, roast pork, garlic mashed potatoes, peas and carrots with a very rich chocolate cake for dessert.

Friday dawned cool and clear with a brisk west wind. I didn’t get up until 7:00 a.m., and after breakfast gave Ivy a short walk, put the decoys on board my boat, and spent the rest of the morning reading in the club room. In the afternoon I napped and gave Ivy another short walk.

There were twenty at the table for dinner: Caesar salad, perfectly done New York strip roast, sautéed green beans, roast potatoes and Abe’s special chocolate flan for dessert. As always the mood was festive and I felt honored to be in the President’s chair at the head of the table.

On Saturday morning, simply being able to go out hunting was a delight; bagging a mallard and a spoonie for six rounds fired was icing on the cake. The sky was clear with a moderate wind out of the west. I knew I’d need help in the pond and Steve Martinelli kindly agreed to shoot with me in blind \#26. We went out in my boat; Steve set the decoys and hid the boat so I wouldn’t have to wade in the mud. We were ready just after shooting time. The sky was filled with ducks; but the fly in the ointment was that almost half of them were spoonies. I hit a duck with my first two rounds. It fell in the deep pond about 100 yards to the east. Ivy swam after it but it kept diving on her and eventually escaped. My next shot brought down another duck in the same area. Ivy missed the mark so Steve went out to help her. Ivy finally caught the duck and brought it in. I was disappointed that it was a spoonie. Finally, I downed a mallard that fell in the short grass about 40 yards out, an easy retrieve for Ivy. I wasn’t able to stand up quickly enough to take advantage of some opportunities and missed another shot, but with the mallard on my strap I relaxed and enjoyed the sight of all the ducks in the air, grateful just to be out on the marsh. Meanwhile, Steve’s helpfulness was rewarded with a successful hunt: a sprig, a mallard, a gadwall and two spoonies, all retrieved by Ivy.

However, the sudden death of Skoal, Andy Stone’s ten year-old yellow Labrador cast a pall of sadness over the morning. Skoal had been in perfect health but as he was swimming back to Andy with a duck he suffered heart failure and could not be resuscitated.

At the end of the hunt Ivy was very tired and so was I. We had spaghetti with an excellent meat sauce for lunch.

Our other hunters did reasonably well. Twelve year-old Cooper Powell went out on his first duck hunt with his dad Mike and outshot him with two pintail and a spoonie, compared to Mike’s three spoonies. Richard Vaccari limited at \#12 with seven good ducks.

Bag: one mallard and one spoonie for six cartridges.

**Wednesday, October 26, 2011: Adverse Weather**

On this hunt there were quite a few ducks in the air and even some geese, but only the spoonies came anywhere near our blind. Blame the weather, warm, clear with only a light breeze; it could hardly be worse for duck hunting.

Tuesday afternoon was clear and mild with a 5 mph. west wind. We crossed the river at 3:00 0’clock. “They’re out there” was Harlan’s reply to my question about the ducks. Ivy and I walked out to the bend in the road and again saw mallards sunning themselves. There were many ducks in the air just before sunset. Our dinner was green salad with ranch dressing, baked chicken, rice and ratatouille with yellow cake for dessert.

The forecast for the morning had called for strong north winds but the day dawned clear and calm. Marc and I went to blind \#8 and were ready at shooting time. A few minutes later I fired one shot at a duck, missed and then recognized it as a spoonie. Marc fired several round at high mallards but failed to connect. At 10:00 o’clock we decided to go in. Even though Ivy hadn’t done any work, she was visibly tired. Instead of running off as she used to do, she plodded around the pond and had to be lifted into my boat. This condition, coupled with her deafness, persuaded me that she should no longer go hunting.

Jim Graziani and Mike Corsetti enjoyed a successful morning at blind \#21; they bagged eight good ducks and Jim, after being skunked on Opening Day, made some very good shots.

We had Rubin sandwiches for lunch and left the Club at 1:50.

Bag: skunked for one round fired.

**Saturday, October 29, 2011: Another Quiet Morning**

The most significant event of this hunt occurred before I set out from home. Ivy formally announced her retirement from duck hunting. In previous years, as I was leaving the house with my overnight bag, Ivy would run ahead to the garage and jump into the Land Rover; this day she simply nodded to me from the sunny spot in the garden where she lay, then put her head down and resumed her nap. I missed Ivy’s company on the drive to the dock but realized that her decision was justified; her arduous work over the years had earned her a comfortable retirement.

We crossed the river at the normal time, 4:00 o’clock. On entering my room I saw four small holes in my pillowcase, undeniably the work of rodents. Harlan reported that there were ducks “out there” and I saw a few in the air on my solitary walk to the bend in the road. I spent the cocktail hour watching the World Series. Our dinner was green salad, roast pork with brown gravy, roast potatoes and broccoli. Dessert was a treat, bread pudding with Jack Daniels sauce.

I had a middling blind pick and invited Steve Martinelli to join me in blind \#21; we went out in his boat. The sky was clear, the temperature mild with a light wind from the west. There were some ducks flying at high altitude but nothing came close enough to shoot at. My two achievements of the morning were getting in and out of the blind without much difficulty and recognizing and holding fire on the solitary spoonie that came to our decoys. One drake mallard approached our blind but turned away at 70 yards.

Shooting was slow all over the club, except for blind \#8, where Andy Stone and Blaine Hutson, our new season shooter, got three mallards. Frank bagged a sprig at blind \#12.

**Two Hunts Missed**

Doctors’ appointments kept me in town for the hunts of Wednesday, November 2nd and Saturday, November 5th. On Tuesday, November 1st, the wind was so strong that Jim Graziani had a hard time backing the boat out of its slip at McAvoy. Out on the river waves were breaking over the bow and Jim had to head directly into the wind to prevent the boat from capsizing. There were four at the club; only Richard Vaccari and Marc Pasquini went out; Marc was high Gun with one spoonie.

The hunting was a little better on Saturday; Jim Koeppen bagged a goose at blind \#12. Meanwhile, Harlan trapped two rats in my room.

**Wednesday, November 9, 2011: A Fantasy of Sweet Revenge**

On Tuesday afternoon we crossed the river at 3:00 o’clock; the sky was clear and the temperature mild with a light wind from the east. There were only five of us, Les and Richard Vaccari, Jim Koeppen, Marc and myself. I was able to walk almost out to the gate and saw a dozen or so spoonies in the pond by the road. My presence didn’t bother them very much.

Dinner was doubly satisfying. The meal itself was splendid: poached Alaska salmon from my fishing trip, risotto with porcini mushrooms and asparagus, with pumpkin pie for dessert. I fancied that the salmon on which we were feasting was the very fish that had caused my knee injury. Mark Pasquini, our assistant beverage commissioner, procured a case of excellent and reasonably priced French table wine that went very well.

The morning dawned clear and cool with a scattering of cirrus clouds and a fresh northeast wind. I took Marc out to blind \#15 and was pleased to be able to get into and out of the blind unaided. There were many more ducks in the air than we’d seen previously but very few shooting opportunities. A mallard passed within range but the sun’s glare prevented Marc from seeing it on time.

Shortly before 9:00, a middle sized duck passed in front of us at 35 yards, we fired simultaneously and both shots connected. As it lay still on the water the duck looked like a hen mallard but when Marc picked it up it proved to be a large hen spoonie. Like two fighter pilots who jointly down an enemy aircraft, we each took credit for one-half of the kill. Meanwhile, Richard Vaccari bagged three ducks at \#12, one of them a hen sprig.

Lunch was excellent, stuffed sweet bell peppers from Harlan’s garden.

Bag: One-half a spoonie for one round fired. Ratio: 2:00 per-bird.

**Saturday, November 12, 2011: An Easy Morning**

On Friday afternoon a moderate weather system brought light winds and intermittent rain showers to the Bay Area.  We crossed the river at 3:30. At 6:00 o’clock, just as we were leaving to go to Wheeler Island for the annual marsh party, heavy rain began to fall.

Approximately forty guests were in attendance, fewer than in recent years. Our hosts presented a spread of hors d’oeuvres including a tasty spoonie breast pate. The main meal was Caesar salad, barbequed New York strip roast, mashed potatoes, green beans and white cake for dessert. Nearly everyone commented about the great number of spoonies on the marsh this season. I enjoyed the evening and didn’t get back to the club and into bed until 10:00 o’clock.

On Saturday morning the rain had passed leaving a high overcast with a light northeast wind. I didn’t feel particularly energetic so I stayed in and took an hour’s nap after breakfast. By 8:00 o’clock I was feeling better so I took my boat out for a long ride around the club. By this time the overcast was breaking up and there was no wind. I saw about a dozen mallards get up from \#23 pond but very little else. For most of the time, the sky was empty. I spent the remainder of the morning reading and chatting with Jim Koeppen, who also stayed in.

However some of those who went out had good results. Tad Bowers and his guest went to blind \#15; they brought in some good ducks and three Canada geese. The twelve hunters who went out bagged at total of sixteen ducks; unfortunately ten of them were spoonies.

We had spaghetti with Italian sausage gravy and left the club a little before 2:00’ o’clock.

**  
Wednesday, November 17, 2011: “I smell a rat!”**

On this outing the most noteworthy event occurred on Tuesday. We crossed the river at 4:00 o’clock under a clear but hazy sky with a light wind from the northeast. Gladys was away so I had Ivy with me. At the club I was greeted by a strange smell in my room. Thinking it might be propane, I opened the window wide and turned on the fan, but the smell did not abate. Later, we pulled out my bed and discovered a decomposing rat on the carpet. There was also a rodents’ nest in the far corner. I moved to another room. Next morning someone posted this note on my door: “You’ve heard about ‘fragging.’ If you don’t shape up as President, the next one will be in your bed.”

Dinner couldn’t help but being far more pleasant: chicken cacciatore with polenta and asparagus followed by tiramisu for dessert.

Wednesday morning was delightful, with a perfectly clear sky and a fresh northeast wind, a morning so beautiful that made it joy simply to be out in the marsh. Marc and I went to blind \#10. He had several opportunities and connected with a drake spoonie. I was looking the other way when a pair of mallards flew directly overhead. We came in at 10:00 o’clock and then I gave Ivy a walk along the road. In previous years she’d howl in protest if she thought I was going out without her but this time she was quite content to stay behind in the kennel.

Richard Vaccari was high Gun with a mallard, a sprig, three teal and two spoonies at blind \#12. We had chef’s salad for lunch and left the club at 2:00 o’clock.

Bag: skunked for no cartridges fired.

**Saturday, November 20, 2011: Meeting the Understudy**

Intermittent rain was falling on Friday afternoon with a fresh wind from the southeast but the weather was the last thing on my mind because waiting for me at the boat was a two year-old female yellow Labrador named Siena, a candidate to succeed Ivy on the marsh. Siena hails from southern California and Frank Fiala, who was picking up his own new dog Cali from the same trainer, brought her to meet me. It’s said that first impressions are the best ones and Siena immediately impressed me as good looking, friendly, indeed overly so, and eager to please but unsure how to do so.

We arrived at the club later than usual because of the tide so I couldn’t do much with Siena other than take her for a short walk before dark. Inside the clubhouse I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Harlan had installed new carpet and rat proof floor molding in my room. It now smelled fresh and clean.

Abe our chef was away but Harlan served a simple but enjoyable dinner: barbequed New York steaks, baked potatoes, Brussels sprouts and apple pie for dessert. The night was cold so I brought Siena into my room but she kept waking me up every forty-five minutes so at 1:00 a.m. I took her out, dressed her in a neoprene jacket and put her in the kennel.

On Saturday I left my gun at the club and took Sienna out to blind \#23 with Andy Stone. The morning was bright and clear and dreadfully slow. Except for the occasional mallard no closer than 300 yards away, there were simple no ducks. Andy didn’t fire a shot. Sienna stayed reasonably calm in the blind and (understandingly) fell asleep for the last half-hour. However, her final acceptance would await word from Steve Orenbaum, a well regarded trainer who had worked with both Daisy and Ivy and understood my needs. On Monday I took her to Steve’s kennels in Cordelia. Steve worked with her for a while and then announced his verdict, “Bob, you made a wise investment; she’s the perfect dog for you.” I left her with Steve for some finishing work.

I missed the next three hunts, two for medical reasons, the third for an immensely enjoyable event. On Saturday, November 26th I attended the Stanford-Notre Dame game, a 28-14 Stanford victory, in the course of which Andrew Luck broke John Elway’s touchdown passing record.

**Wednesday, November 30, 2011: Siena’s Progress**

Tuesday the 29th was another in the succession of those late autumn days of hazy stagnant weather, the bane of duck hunters. Marc and I picked up Siena at Steve Orenbaum’s place and he gave me a lesson in handling her. It’s true; dog owners need at least as much training as their canine companions. We crossed the river at 4:00 o’clock and I took my longest walk of the season, all the way out to the gate, a total distance of one mile. I kept Siena on leash and she responded reasonably well.

We had another excellent dinner featuring veal scaloppini, rice, string beans and bread pudding with bourbon sauce for dessert.

The morning dawned clear and calm. Marc and I took Siena to blind \#26. Early in the hunt Siena fussed about and refused to settle down. Marc had the bright idea of letting her sit on his canvas decoy bag and she immediately settled down on it. Glare was the problem it usually is at \#26 on clear days and we failed to see a drake mallard that passed in front of us in easy range. Siena did get her first ducks, a spoonie that Marc downed that fell 50 yards behind a patch of tulles and a second spoonie that we combined on that fell much further away. Siena failed to mark either bird. Marc went out for the first one, pointed her toward it and when she saw it on the water, she swam to it and brought it in. I went out to point her to the second one, in the process waded about 75 yards. It was my first walk on a pond bottom since the knee surgery. Siena held both birds until we took them from her. During the morning we saw a number of ducks in the air, but they were all well out of range.

We had hot lamb sandwiches with mashed potatoes and gravy and left the club shortly after 1:00 o’clock.

Cali went to blind \#12 with Frank and retrieved a pintail and a goose nearly her size.

**Wednesday, December 20, 2011: Fogged In**

Muriel’s final days, her funeral and associated family matters occupied the next three weeks. During this sad time I greatly appreciated the kindness shown me by our members. Meanwhile the weather remained discouragingly stagnant and I came down a cold. Thus I had no desire to go duck hunting.

On the morning of Tuesday, December 19th, Marc and I went to Cordelia, picked up Siena at Steve Orenbaum’s where he gave me additional training in handling her. We then proceeded to McAvoy, crossed the river at 1:00 o’clock and had sandwiches at the club. I spent much of the afternoon practicing with Siena.

Dinner was the high point of the hunt: braised rabbit with polenta, broccoli and bananas Foster for dessert.

At midnight a fog settled over the marsh; in the morning visibility was less than 50 yards, with the temperature at 37 degrees. This was the worst fog I’d experienced in my twenty-nine years on the marsh. All of us stayed in except Marc, who took Jim Graziani’s grandson Ryan to blind \#8. They didn’t fire a shot.

The fog diminished around noon and after sandwiches for lunch we crossed the river without much difficulty. I felt that until the weather changed going to the club would be a futile exercise. This duck season was proving to be even more disappointing than the previous one.

**Wednesday, January 11, 2012: An Astonishing Morning**

My cold persisted, and this, combined with the stagnant weather, the Christmas and New Year’s holidays and a general lack of enthusiasm for duck hunting, led me to stay home for three weeks. I used some of the interval productively and took Siena and Gladys for a training session with Steve Orenbaum. He suggested that her development might be facilitated by the use of an electronic training aid and let me borrow one of his with the result that her behavior at home improved markedly.

Tuesday’s weather was cloudless, hazy and mild with a light north wind. We crossed at 4:00 o’clock. I took Siena for a sunset walk but saw no ducks. Dinner was roast pork loin with sage dressing, roasted potatoes and broccoli with hollandaise sauce, concluding with carrot cake.

Wednesday morning dawned cloudless and calm although later in the morning a light wind came up from the west. I had first pick and invited Marc to join me at blind \#12. He took the point blind and I the inner island. Around 7:15, a pintail came toward the decoys about 40 yards high. I brought it down with one shot. It fell closer to Marc and was still swimming so he fired a disabling shot. Siena failed to mark it so I went out with her; when she saw the duck floating on the pond she went to it and brought it in. This was my first good duck since opening day and my first pintail in several years. About 45 minutes later I called in a flock of teal and brought one down on the water 18 yards southwest of the island. She saw this one, went right to it and brought it in. Later I fired a shot at a gadwall that fell about 30 yards away. Again, she swam out without hesitation and brought it in. I also missed a shot at a spoonie. Toward the end of the morning I fired two rounds at some teal that were fairly high overhead. I hit one lightly and it came down in the nut grass about 60 yards north of the blind. I took Siena out and we hunted the surrounding area without success. Siena coursed back and forth with an eagerness that obviated any doubts about her bird desire. I was gratified to see her working so keenly. Also, her demeanor in the blind was considerably improved. I only had to press the button one time and afterward just showed her the transmitter to get her to calm down.

Marc and I came in at 10:30. I was surprised to find out that mine were the only ducks taken this day.

We had leftover pork and scalloped potatoes for lunch.

Bag: one pintail, one teal and one gadwall for six cartridges.

**Saturday, January 14, 2012: An Extremely Quiet Morning**

Friday afternoon was cool, clear and almost windless. We crossed the river at 4:00 o’clock. I took a sunset walk with Siena about half way to the gate and saw a dozen or so mallards in the area near Division Road.

For dinner we had grilled New York steaks, French fries, sautéed red chard and Bananas Foster for dessert.

Saturday dawned clear and calm with the temperature in the high 30’s. Hoping to repeat Wednesday’s triumph, I picked blind \#12 and invited Andy Stone to come along and take the outer or “point” blind. Unfortunately the morning was the quietest of the season, with hardly any of the usual bird life, i.e., swallows, hawks, seagulls, etc. Around 8:30 a flock of teal flew by too low to shoot at. One of them landed in the nut grass 35 yards northeast of the blind. I fired one shot and saw it roll over but it flew off when Siena went after it.

We had spaghetti and meatballs for lunch and left from Wheeler Island. The boat had been moved there in the morning because of the low tide at our dock.

Others had better results. A total of twenty-two ducks were taken; Erik Cushman was high Gun with five teal.

**Wednesday, January 18, 2012: My Farewell Hunt**

On Tuesday, an unusual tide required us to cross at noon. There was little change in the weather; it remained stagnant but not nearly as cold. In the afternoon I walked out to the gate and saw seven mallards on an island near the junction. Siena walked off leash for most of the walk and was very controllable. I greatly enjoyed her company. I spent the late afternoon reading in my room.

Dinner was barbecued leg of lamb, roasted potatoes and sautéed red chard, with bread pudding and bourbon sauce for dessert. Freezing temperatures were forecast and since Siena was still too lively to sleep in my room, I dressed her in her neoprene jacket and tucked her down in my boat room.

Wednesday dawned cold, clear and calm. Marc and I went out to blind \#8. Once again, very few ducks were flying although there were quite a few geese. Some of them landed in the grass between blinds \#9 and \#10. Around 8:30 both of us shot at a gadwall. It came down near the tulles 40 yards east of us and swam into them. I took Siena out; she hunted the area diligently and once or twice appeared to have picked up the scent, but she was unable to find the duck.

We went in early because of the tide and after a hurried lunch of lasagna, left the club shortly before noon.

This was my last hunt of the season because John Batley’s visit preempted the final week. My days with him were the most enjoyable in months.

**Looking Back**

Considering the season as a simple duck hunter, my total of four good ducks made it dismal, my worst ever. However, my view from the president’s chair is quite different: thankfully the season passed without injury, accident or significant damage to our property. The field work at the club during the summer made the property attractive for many more ducks than in previous years, credit to Jim Graziani. However, where those ducks vanished to on hunting days remains a mystery. On another positive note, the quality of our food and wine ranged from good to excellent. In spite of the generally poor hunting, our members and especially our guests appeared to enjoy their time at the club. On a personal note, my recuperation progressed and as the season wore on, I grew stronger and more limber. And Siena, while making slow, sometime agonizingly slow, progress settling in at home, showed that she possesses the necessary hunting ability and desire. In conclusion, I’ve much for which to be thankful as I join all of us in hoping for better results this coming fall.
