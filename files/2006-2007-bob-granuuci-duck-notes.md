**2006 - 2007 Duck Season Journal**

*“In my opinion, the be all and end all of all . . . decoying is the study and application of fieldcraft. I believe in being at one with nature and studying the bird which you are hunting. It is a privilege to hunt wild creatures and this privilege must be earned.”* John Batley

**Introduction**

Our club’s plans to carry out plans for extensive field were during the off-season were hampered by late-winter flooding. Worse yet, in early summer the discharge pipe under the levee ruptured while the pump was running and the flow of water washed away much of the soil on the levee next to the fuel tank. The repairs were expensive but fortunately, the pump had been shut off before the tank was undermined, otherwise, we would have been faced with a catastrophic fuel spill. Despite these setbacks, during the summer months we accomplished substantial improvements to the property, digging new drainage ditches, widening others, and sculpting some of the ponds to create islands and establish more high ground between them. This work was intended to increase the flow of fresh water across our ponds, improve the habitat and thus attract more ducks.

**October 21, 2006: A Star-Crossed Opening Day**

The drive to McAvoy Harbor on Friday morning didn’t feel particularly different from the several overnight trips I’d made to the club during the off-season. The day was clear and a warm 78 degrees at McAvoy Harbor, with a steady 7-10 mph. wind out of the northeast. We arrived at the Club at 1:30. Ryan Murphy lifted my outboard motor into my boat, a much appreciated favor. After loading my decoys and the other gear, I took the boat out and tested the motor. It had failed on my final hunt in January. The mechanic who serviced it in August said the problem was fuel starvation caused by a cracked fuel line, which he replaced. The motor ran perfectly. With that problem apparently solved, I took Ivy for a walk out to the gate during which we saw a gratifying number of ducks. Afterward I rested in my room until cocktail time.

The twenty members and sons in attendance created a festive atmosphere in the clubroom and they made short work of a spread of hors d’oeuvres consisting of smoked salmon appetizers and a tasty artichoke/red pepper dip. At 7:00 o’clock, we repaired to the dining room for our traditional pre-opening meal: Caesar salad, roast beef, asparagus, mashed potatoes and for dessert, a specially decorated chocolate sheet cake bearing the message, “Happy Hunting.”

That message came true for most others, but not for me. Saturday dawned clear and mild, with a brisk wind blowing from the north. Steve Martinelli invited me to hunt with me in blind \#10. The high spirits in which Ivy and I set out from the dock turned to chagrin about 400 yards up Noyce Slough when once again, my motor suddenly died. Fortunately, Chris and Owen Charles saw us drifting helplessly. They came to the rescue and towed us back to the dock, where Mike Corsetti kindly offered me the use of his boat.

I grabbed my gun and equipment bag and sped out to join Steve, reaching the blind just before shooting time. Then I realized that I’d left Ivy’s tie-down in my own boat. She behaved reasonably well but she didn’t want to lie down and spent the morning on her feet, her tail continuously wagging. This wouldn’t have been a problem at a blind like \#4, which has ample brush, but blind \#10 was almost bare of cover and I was concerned that the motion might scare off the ducks. The wind shifted to the northeast and strengthened. Although there were plenty of ducks in the air, only a few came close enough to shoot at. I missed two shots at marginal range, but solidly hit a hen mallard that fell into light cover about 50 yards northwest of the blind. Ivy was quickly out and back with the bird. The action slowed after 8:30. Shortly after 9:00, I hit a mallard drake. It set its wings and came almost straight down, much like a VTOL plane. Unfortunately it landed in tulles that were too dense for Ivy to penetrate.

Greatly disappointed at losing a prime duck, I packed up and went in. Before lunchtime, Harlan managed to start my motor so I took the boat out and gave it a lengthy test. It ran without any problems. We had spaghetti for lunch.

I drove home with the radio tuned to “The Nightmare in the Desert,” i.e., Stanford’s 38-3 trouncing at the hands of Arizona State. When I arrived, I found myself locked out because I’d left my house keys at the club. I had to go borrow a set from John and Paula. When I finally got into the house, I poured myself a restorative libation while recalling that old song, “When You Come to the End of a Perfect Day.”

Other: except for Steve Martinelli, who got skunked, everybody bagged some ducks. Les and Richard Vaccari got a limit each at blind \#15. However, the total number of ducks taken amounted to seventy-seven, the poorest opening day in recent history. A number of members stayed over Saturday night. Frank barbecued some of the mallards taken that morning and everyone said they were perfectly cooked. A few more ducks were shot on Sunday, but generally the shooting was poor.

On Saturday, Chad Lyon and Ryan Murphy, who were shooting in blind \#7, brought down a goose but they couldn’t find it. On Sunday morning Steve Martinelli and Rich Vaccari were going out to fish in Noyce Slough when they came upon Frank Fiala, who was making tight circles in his own boat. He shouted to them, “Does anybody have a gun? He was trying to corral a large crippled goose, probably the one that was shot on Saturday. Steve and Rich didn’t have a gun, but they had Becky. She jumped into the water, grabbed the goose and started swimming back to the boat house. Becky was already very tired after the previous day’s exertions and Rich and Steve felt she wouldn’t be able to make it all the way back. They “herded” her to the reeds along the shore and after a struggle during which both of them fell in the mud, they managed to get dog and goose aboard their boat and bring them in.

Result: one mallard for six shots fired. Ratio: 6:00 cartridges per bird. One duck lost.

**Wednesday, October 25, 2006: One is the Loneliest Number**

Tuesday afternoon was mild and hazy with a fresh wind from the west. We crossed the river at 4:00 o’clock. I immediately took my boat out and made several high speed runs. The motor ran well and eased my concerns about the morning. There were only five others at the club: Jim Graziani, Chris Charles, Jim Koeppen, George Couch and Marc Pasquini. During the cocktail hour, Jim, Marc and I watched the World Series. For dinner we had an avocado and tomato salad, roast chicken with roasted potatoes, sautéed string beans and cherry pie *a la mode.*

At 5:00 o’clock on Wednesday morning, the sky was clear with a fresh 10 mph. wind blowing from the northeast. I had first pick and invited Marc to join me in blind \#12. He took the outer island and I, the inner one. At shooting time the wind died down. We saw a number of ducks in the distance traveling east to west. I had what looked like two opportunities and fired a total of three rounds, but these ducks were probably out of range. I’d argue in my defense that that they looked much nearer that anything else I’d seen all morning. Marc brought down a hen spoonie that Ivy retrieved briskly. He also hit what probably was another spoonie. It came down in open water about 100 yards north of my blind. Ivy went out but couldn’t find it. After 8:30 nothing was flying. At 9:30, Ivy and I made another unsuccessful try for the missing duck, and then I picked up and started back to the club.

I’d almost reached the \#11 pond boat ditch when once again, my motor died. I was annoyed but not seriously concerned because Marc was behind me. He came along about fifteen minutes later and towed me back to the dock. Then we learned that Marc was high Gun; his spoonie was the morning’s only duck.

We had cold cuts for lunch. On the way home, I stopped at the boat works and the mechanic lent me a different gas tank to try. He said he’d use a process of elimination until the problem was identified.

Bag: Skunked for three rounds fired.

**Saturday, October 28, 2006: Progress of a Sort**

This day’s hunt saw a marked improvement in the bag’s quality but not its quantity. Friday afternoon was mild and hazy. As soon as we arrived at the Club, I tried my motor. When it refused to start I knew it had to go back to the mechanic on Monday. Ivy and I took our customary walk but the only ducks in the air were too far away to be seen with the naked eye.

Dinner was splendid: a nice salad with Jim Graziani’s Italian dressing, boneless leg of lamb perfectly barbecued by Mike Corsetti, accompanied by sautéed new potatoes and ratatouille.

Saturday morning was clear and calm at shooting time. Jim Koeppen and I went to blind \#26 in his boat. This would be the first day of shooting at Wheeler Island, and we surmised that some ducks might be chased our way. Actually, the only ducks that came within range were two spoonies that we let pass. We came in at 9:15 without having fired a shot. By this time a 5-8 mph. wind had begun to blow from the northeast

In fact, nobody had any ducks until Steve Martinelli and Andy Stone came back from blind \#15 with a handsome drake mallard on Andy’s strap. Once again, by the narrowest of margins, our club had avoided a total shutout.

We had chicken pot pie for lunch.

Bag: skunked, no cartridges fired.

**Wednesday, November 1, 2006: Improvement**

I enjoyed this hunt more than the previous ones. Tuesday afternoon was noticeably cooler, with a scattering of high clouds in an otherwise clear sky and a steady west wind.

I drove in with Marc and Jim Koeppen because none of us felt confident about handling the boat. We arrived at the Club a little before two o’clock; Richard Vaccari was already there. Mike Corsetti had kindly allowed me to use his boat while he was away so I shifted my decoys and gear into it and then took Ivy for a walk out to the gate. I saw more ducks than I’d seen so far this season. At cocktail time we sat on the porch outside the clubroom and watched a number of mallards swimming in the house pond.

We ate dinner at six o’clock; green salad, roast pork loin, roasted potatoes, sautéed chard and apple pie *a la mode.*

I woke up at 4:00 a.m. when a skunk sprayed directly outside my window. Was this a portent for the morning? The visibility was clear and the temperature cool; the clouds had lowered and were thicker. I went to blind \#4 and was pleased to be back in my favorite blind. There were very ducks in sight and most of them were well out of range. Shortly before nine o’clock, a pair of mallards came down, circled my blind and passed over the decoys. I focused on the hen and hit it solidly but missed a shot at the drake. Ivy made an easy 15 yard retrieve.

I had the only quarry duck of the morning. Jim Koeppen shot a spoonie at blind \#12.

We had giant hamburgers for lunch.

Bag: one mallard for two cartridges. Ratio: 2.00 per-bird.

**Wednesday, November 8, 2006: Motor Trouble Becomes Contagious**

Instead of hunting on Saturday, I went to the Stanford-USC game with Fred Brosio. I was impressed with the new stadium and enjoyed our customary post game dinner as much as always. However, little can be said for being on the wrong side of 42-0.

Meanwhile at the club, eight shooters brought in nine ducks, a marked improvement. Chris Charles had a pre dawn misadventure. He went to blind \#6, set his decoys and hid his boat, but when he opened the barrel, he found the stool was missing. At this time, Jim Graziani was coming down the ditch on his way to blind \#4. At Chris’ request, Jim took Chris across the pond to blind \#5, where Chris borrowed the stool from that barrel. Then they headed back to blind \#6, or so they thought. Actually, they had both become disoriented in the heavy overcast. As a result, Jim put Chris ashore on the wrong side of the pond. Chris wandered around until it became bright enough for him to realize where he was. He had to carry the stool across the pond. His exertions did not go unrewarded because he bagged a mallard, the first duck shot at our new blind. However, on the way in, his motor ran badly and when he reached the dock, gasoline was leaking out of the carburetor. He had to take it to the mechanic.

Tuesday afternoon was bright and clear, with a strong wind out of the west. I picked up my motor from the mechanic and when we reached the club, Jim Graziani and Chris Charles lifted it into my boat. It ran when I started it so I took Ivy for a walk. We saw a number of ducks in the air.

The four of us, Jim Koeppen, Chris, Marc and I, enjoyed an outstanding dinner, roast turkey with all the trimmings, and pumpkin pie for dessert.

On Wednesday morning the southern edge of a weather system passed over the marsh. There was no rain but at sunrise the marsh was painted a firry red and during the morning the sky was covered with a variety of clouds. I went to blind \#4 and made the trip out and back without any problem. There weren’t many ducks to shoot at. I had two marginal chances and missed both times. Jim Graziani was high gun with three mallards at blind \#26 but as he was returning to the dock, his four-stroke motor overheated and he too had to take it across the river to the mechanic.

For lunch we made sandwiches with the leftover turkey.

Bag: Skunked for three cartridges fired. Cumulative total: two mallards for fourteen rounds fired with one duck lost. Season ratio: 7.00.

**Saturday, November 11, 2006: A Successful Party**

This was our year to host the marsh party so we crossed the river at 10:00 o’clock and on arriving immediately set to work preparing the club to host our neighboring clubs.

I helped set up the bar and performed some other tasks. At 2:00 o’clock I took Ivy for a walk. We saw quite a few ducks on and over our club. I was looking forward to the morning. The company arrived shortly after six. We greeted our guests with a spread of hors d’oeuvres to enjoy with their drinks and for dinner, served barbecued tri-tip, chili and a romaine lettuce salad. A number of guests came back for second helpings. For dessert we had a chocolate sheet cake with a duck in the center and trimmed with green frosting to represent marsh grass. After an evening as convivial as could be wished for, the party broke up at 9:30.

Jim Graziani was hosting his grandson so I lent him my boat. Mike Corsetti had first choice and invited Ivy and me to accompany him to blind \#12. However, in the morning it was raining and a cold wind was blowing out of the east. Neither of us was particularly eager to go out. I rested in my room until 10:00 o’clock, when the rain stopped, and then took Ivy for a walk. I couldn’t see any ducks flying. However the hunters who braved the storm had fairly good shooting. Harlan used some of the leftover beef to make enchiladas for lunch.

Other: Jim Graziani’s grandson Brian shot his very first duck at blind \#21.

**Wednesday, November 15, 2006: Unexpected Success**

We had an early boat on Tuesday afternoon. It had rained hard on Monday and Harlan reported that the rain had chased all the ducks off the marsh. I spent about an hour out walking with Ivy and saw a grand total of three ducks in the far distance. The prospects were dim.

Our dinner was earlier than usual. Harlan’s creativity came to the fore. He served thin slices of leftover beef covered with sautéed mushrooms, accompanied with baked potatoes fresh broccoli and banana pie for dessert.

On Wednesday morning there were scattered high clouds while three miles to the north a heavy ground fog covered the base of the Potrero Hills. There was no wind, only the slightest movement of air from varying directions. I went to blind \#4 and spent most of the morning gazing into an empty sky. My luck changed at 8:30, when a large drake mallard flew overhead, took a look at my decoys and circled back about 40 yards high. I connected with my first round, and fired again as it set its wings and started losing altitude. The duck sailed across the pond, splashed down in the bay behind blind \#5, fluttered a few times and then floated motionless. As Ivy swam out to retrieve it, I measured the distance with my rangefinder and got a reading of 200 yards. In other words, when she returned to the blind, Ivy had swum a quarter of a mile.

We had pastrami sandwiches for lunch.

Bag: one mallard for two cartridges. Ratio: 2.00 per-bird.

**Saturday, November 18, 2006: Surprises Bad and Good**

We crossed the river at 3:00 p.m. under a partly cloudy sky with a light wind from the west. The temperature was in the high 60’s and it felt even warmer. I walked Ivy out to the gate and saw six mallards get up from the pond by the road.

The members, sons, grandsons and guests present totaled nineteen leaving no extra space at the dinner table. The meal was a standout: green salad, baked wild salmon (caught by Jim Koeppen in Alaska), and mashed potatoes, asparagus and pecan pie.

The temperature was still mild when I tucked Ivy down for the night and I surmised that we’d enjoy a fog free morning. I was wrong. A very dense fog formed after midnight. Chris invited me to hunt with him in blind \#12. The fog was so thick that it I had to take off my glasses on the way out to the blind; I ran my boat slowly while hugging the left shore of Noyce Slough.

At shooting time visibility was less than 100 yards. I spent the next three hours waiting for the fog to lift. During this time, a flight of ducks raced by. Thinking they might be teal, I fired and brought one down. It turned out to be a goldeneye. The fog lifted at 9:30. I fired a shot at a mallard at marginal range. It circled the pond, apparently unbothered, and then flew off into the distance. A short time later, a duck set its wings and headed for my decoys. I brought it down with an overhead shot. It fell in the pickleweed about 30 yards north of the blind. Ivy chased it down and brought it in. Perhaps I was still somewhat depressed as a result of sitting in the fog for such a long time. In any event, I didn’t look at it too closely when I put in on my strap, assuming it was a large hen spoonie. When I got back to the club, Mike Corsetti said, “Bob, that’s no spoonie.” I looked again and only then observed the topaz wing bar that marks a hen mallard. It was a small one, but a mallard nonetheless. I was somewhat embarrassed about my misidentification but overall, felt much better about the morning’s results.

We had Tuscan bean and tuna salad for lunch.

Bag: one mallard and one goldeneye for three rounds, a 1.50 ratio.

Other: our nineteen hunters bagged four mallards, one teal and four non quarry ducks. At blind \#10 Jim and Kurt Koeppen got a cock pheasant which had, unluckily for it, flown directly over their blind. At first they thought it was a coot; the bird met its end when they noticed its long tail. It’s been a long time since a pheasant has been shot from a blind at our club.

**Wednesday, November 22, 2006: An Uneventful Morning**

Tuesday afternoon was clear with scattered mid-level clouds. It was dead calm which me to try my hand at piloting the *Saint Germain* across the river. The boat takes its time in responding to the wheel so anticipation is required, especially when docking. However, we made it across without any fuss. On my walk with Ivy, I saw several flights of ducks in the air, giving me hope for the morning.

There were eight of us at the club. We dined on buffalo meat loaf, mashed potatoes, green beans and apple pie for dessert.

On Wednesday morning the sky was covered with high overcast, a light wind was coming from the southwest and rain was forecast for the afternoon. I felt a drop or two on our way out to blind \#4, but the morning remained dry. I twice had spoonies over the island but my only chance was a drake mallard that crossed at fifty-five yards. I fired two shots at it but the bird flew off unscathed. At 9:30 I picked up and returned to the dock via the new ditch between \#4 pond and Division Line Slough.

We had chicken pot pie for lunch. On our return crossing I again piloted the boat and with must have been beginner’s luck, executed a flawless entry into our berth at McAvoy Harbor.

Bag: Skunked for two rounds fired.

Other: Jim Koeppen bagged three quarry ducks at blind \#12. Marc, who was shooting in \#12A, doubled on spoonies.

**Wednesday, November 29, 2006: An Inconsequential Oversight**

On Tuesday afternoon a cold wind was blowing out of the west but the crystal clear sky decorated with a variety of clouds and the unlimited horizontal visibility made the day as pleasant as could be wished for. Richard Vaccari, Marc and I made a rapid crossing as guests on Wheeler Island’s *Black Mallard*. With a further hospitable touch, Jeff Lewis, Wheeler’s keeper, drove us to the club.

Ivy and I took a leisurely walk out to the gate during which she treated herself to an extended run. The sight of more ducks in the air than I’d seen in a while gave me hope for the morning.

Dinner was simple but satisfying: green salad, baked chicken, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables followed by blackberry pie for dessert. I contributed a bottle of white Burgundy which went well with the meal.

Overnight temperatures were predicted to drop below freezing and accordingly, acting in my capacity as club President *pro tempore*, I suspended Rule Three.[^1]

[^1]: Rule Three prohibits the sheltering of dogs in their masters’ rooms.

The morning was cold and clear, with a moderate wind from the northwest. In the process of bringing Ivy out and dressing her in her neoprene jacket, I forgot to put my gun in my boat. I didn’t realize this until I was pulling away from the dock. I hurried back and retrieved it but as things developed, I needn’t have bothered. I went to blind \#13. I enjoyed being outdoors but had no shooting opportunities. The combination of the northwest wind and the bright sun made blind \#13 a very difficult hunting venue and it will be a long time before I go back there.

We had lasagna for lunch and walked back to Wheeler Island for their 1:00 o’clock boat.

Other: Richard Vaccari got two goldeneye and one striped bass.

**Saturday, December 2, 2006: Grounds for Hope**

The clear brisk weather on this hunt was very much like Wednesday’s and my results were exactly the same, i.e., no shots fired. Nevertheless, I came away from this outing with grounds to hope that my prospects would improve. Because of the tides, we crossed the river at 1:30 and after reading in my room for a while, I took Ivy for a leisurely walk out to the gate and saw more ducks in the air than I’d seen since the eve of opening day.

We dined on green salad, roast pork loin, roasted new potatoes and zucchini sautéed with onions and garlic, our dessert was raspberry cheesecake.

Ivy spent the night in my room. At 6:15 a.m. we set out for blind \#4 under a clear and star-filled sky; there was no wind. I saw quite a few ducks in the air, all of them well out of range, except for the many sea ducks that passed back and forth over my island. I was looking the wrong way when a drake mallard flew low and slow past the bind; from the way the bird was flying, it might have been sick or wounded. I could have fired as it was going out of range but chose not to. By 8:30 a brisk wind was blowing out of the northeast but it didn’t help matters.

Other blinds fared better. Frank and George Couch bagged four mallards and a pintail at blind \#10 and Ryan Murphy and his friend Dan got two teal at blind \#15.

We had half-pound hamburgers for lunch and left the club at 1:30.

**Wednesday, December 6, 2006: Hopes Fulfilled**

Once in a while, everything comes together and one experiences a hunt as enjoyable as could be wished for, a day that casts its glow over the season’s previous blank mornings. Better yet, to share such an extraordinary day with a special friend.

I had first choice on Wednesday and was delighted to be able to host Mike Phelan, a friend of forty years standing. I promised him a fine dinner but cautioned him not to expect much in the way of shooting. We crossed the river at 4:00 o’clock. Mike accompanied Ivy and me on our walk out to the gate. We saw flocks of ducks in the sky but nearly all of them looked like sea ducks.

Dinner was up to expectations: green salad, barbecued steak, asparagus, baked potatoes and dark chocolate cake for dessert

I had first choice, picked blind \#12, and stationed Mike on the outer island while Ivy and I took the inner one. At shooting time the wind was calm, nothing was flying and I resigned myself to the prospect of one more duckless morning. A few minutes later, two small ducks landed in my decoys but it was still too dark to determine whether they were teal or buffleheads. Shortly before sunrise a widgeon flew directly overhead. One shot brought it down right next to the island; Ivy hardly got her feet wet. About this time a fresh wind started blowing out of the east. After that a pair of mallards flew by. I fired a shot at the hen and another at the drake and thought I’d missed both of them. Ivy broke free of her restraint and went out. I called, “Come back you silly dog!” She kept going and eventually retuned carrying the hen. Mike shot a teal and later a fine drake pintail. During the morning the sea ducks put on a spectacular air show, made even more exciting when they were joined by flocks of wildly flying teal. My identification was up to the challenge; I passed up the diving ducks and shot two teal. Mike and I shot one spoonie each. At quarter to ten, a widgeon drake flew by at 45 yards. I fired and it fell about 50 yards northwest of the blind. Ivy had just about reached it when it dove. She made several circles in the water until she spied it swimming toward Mike with its beak barely out of the water. She caught up with it and brought it to hand.

Harlan had to leave in the morning on personal business so he out a spread of cold meats and we made our own sandwiches for lunch.

I piloted the *Saint Germain* on the return crossing. When we docked at McAvoy, I thought Ivy had disembarked before me. I couldn’t find her in the parking lot and enlisted my friends to help search for her. After twenty minutes of fruitless searching I was sorely distressed. I went back and looked in the boat but didn’t see her. After a while I went back, checked the cabin and there she was, asleep in the corner. Chris Charles said that the moral of the story is that much time and anxiety can be wasted by letting sleeping dogs lie.

Bag: One mallard, two widgeon, two teal and one spoonie for fourteen rounds fired. Ratio: 2.33 per bird. Nine retrieves by Ivy with no birds lost.

**Saturday, December 9, 2006: One More Quiet Morning**

Rain was falling when I left San Francisco on Friday afternoon but it was still dry at McAvoy, although the western sky was full of dark clouds. The strong wind from the south confirmed that the rain would soon reach us. Several of our members were delayed in the heavy holiday traffic so our departure was delayed until 4:25. As soon as we docked at the club, I walked Ivy out to the gate but saw no ducks.

Dinner was later than usual but worth the wait: green salad, roast leg of lamb, rice with gravy prepared by Tim Murphy, sautéed snap peas and dark chocolate cake.

It rained during the night but the temperature had sufficiently moderated for Ivy to sleep *al fresco*. At 5:00 a.m., when I went out to feed her, the rain had passed to the east and the sky was partially clear, although there was still a brisk south wind. I went to blind \#4, was ready a few minutes after shooting time, and spent the next two hours enjoying the scenery and the colorful sky. Occasionally a diving duck flew by to break the monotony but there were no shooting opportunities. Around 9:15, I picked up and took a boat ride along the slough that forms the boundary between the east side of our club and Sprig Farm. I saw a dozen mallards fly off from the far side of \#28 pond.

Meanwhile, the sea ducks concentrated themselves in the northwest corner of the club. Chris Charles, who was in blind \#16, said they swarmed around him like mosquitoes and even landed in his decoys. He did well to distinguish and bag a teal that was flying among them. Steve Martinelli and Mike McSweeny hunted in blind \#15 and got twelve diving ducks and one coot.

We had chicken pot pie for lunch.

Bag: Skunked for no rounds fired.

**Wednesday, December 13, 2006: Slim Pickings**

It rained on Sunday and Monday. Because of the tide, we crossed the river shortly after noon on Tuesday. The day was cloudy, with a high fog, light drizzle and an east wind. Because of the tides, we crossed the river shortly after noon. We had lunch at the club, making our own sandwiches from a spread of cold meats and cheeses that Harlan set out. We decided to hunt in the afternoon. Some ducks got up as I was approaching blind \#4. There was almost nothing flying although I did take one overhead shot at a widgeon that was probably out of range. Les Vaccari got a mallard in blind \#21 and Mike Corsetti, a widgeon at blind \#12.

We had barbequed chicken, roasted potatoes and mixed vegetables for dinner; the highlight of the meal was Harlan’s home made banana cream pie for dessert.

Wednesday’s gray and gloomy weather was much like Tuesday’s; a thin ground fog limited horizontal visibility to less than a mile, there was a high overcast and a light east wind. I left my decoys in place and was back in blind \#4 by shooting time. Early on I missed a shot at what looked like a teal but was probably a diving duck. This was the sum of my morning’s action on a day that was equally fruitless for everyone else.

Harlan served an excellent clam chowder after which we made our own sandwiches and left the club before noon because of the dropping tide.

**Saturday, December 16, 2006: Out of Sync**

This hunt is best forgotten but the preliminaries were enjoyable. We crossed the river at 1:30 under a sky decorated with a variety of high clouds. The temperature was in the mid 50’s, with a brisk west and unlimited horizontal visibility. Ivy and I took a leisurely walk out past the gate to the bend in Division Line Road opposite \#1 pond. We were joined by Andy Stone, his yellow Labrador Skoal and Steve Martinelli. Skoal and Ivy frolicked together while we observed the many sea ducks on our ponds plus a few mallards. Some flights of quarry ducks could be seen in the distance.

There were fifteen at the dinner table. We started with chicken Caesar salad, then roast beef, baked potatoes, mixed vegetables and pumpkin pie with whipped cream for dessert. George Couch contributed a very palatable Spanish red wine.

Saturday morning’s temperature was in the low 40’s, the wind was still out of the west and the air was very clear. The cloud cover had lowered and thickened. It felt like a perfect duck hunting morning but that’s not how it turned out. I invited George to join me in blind \#15, where we’d enjoyed some success in the past. Not this time. Ivy fussed all morning. There is no cover on the island and I had trouble keeping her down and quiet. Very few ducks came anywhere near. We called in a flock of teal but missed our shots at them. We also failed to see a pair of mallards that crossed in front of us at 40 yards. I missed several shots and ended the morning badly by lightly hitting a pintail that flew across Noyce slough before it dropped outside our property.

We had chili dogs for lunch.

With the exception of Gary and Erik Cushman in blind \#26 (a pintail and a teal) and Mike Powell in blind \#21 (a teal), success also evaded the rest of our shooters.

Bag: Skunked for five rounds fired, one duck lost.

**Wednesday, December 20, 2006: Back in the Groove**

Tuesday afternoon was typical for late December, cold and hazy with a light southwest wind.

We departed McAvoy at 3:00 o’clock; I piloted to boat and the crossing was accomplished without incident. Ivy and I took our customary walk out to the junction with Division Line Road. We were amused by the aerial antics of the swallows and diving ducks, but saw only a few quarry ducks.

Marc, George Couch, Mike Corsetti and Jim Koeppen and I enjoyed a dinner of green salad with vinaigrette dressing, baked spare ribs, baked beans and mixed vegetables, dark chocolate cake for dessert. The forecast was for sub-freezing temperatures, so I brought Ivy inside and she spent a restful night next to my bed.

The ice on our walkways in the morning validated the forecast. The sky was clear but hazy with a light northeast wind. Marc was having motor trouble so I took him to blind \#15 and went on to shoot in blind \#16. The island has plenty of cover so Ivy could stand up and wag her tail to her heart’s content.

The diving ducks couldn’t resist my decoy spread; they were over, around in even in the decoys all morning. Early on, I fired two ineffective shots at what I thought might be teal. Around 8:30, a flight of five mallards crossed to the north at 40 yards. Because of the heavy cover ‘I hadn’t seen them approach. I picked out a drake, fired and watched it tumble into the pond. I would have done better to have immediately shifted my focus and fire at a second target. In any event, I was glad to have a duck on the water. Ivy swam out about 50 yards and had nearly reached it when it dove. Ivy circled around and then put her head under water and caught it; her very first underwater retrieve.

We had lasagna for lunch.

Bag: One mallard (the day’s only quarry duck) for three rounds fired. Ratio: 3.00.

**Saturday, December 23, 2006: Pre Christmas Festivities**

This hunt featured an outstanding dinner, a brilliant retrieve by Ivy, unusual weather and a few misadventures.

At 4:00 o’clock on Friday afternoon, in addition to its compliment of passengers, the *Saint Germain* was carrying a cargo of live crabs and fresh clams, shrimp, clams and red snapper. As soon as we arrived, Jim Graziani set to work in the kitchen, and with Harlan’s assistance, he put together an outstanding dinner. Chippino night is always especially festive and in terms of both food and camaraderie, the evening was fully up to standard.

The hunt was almost an afterthought. On Saturday morning, the sky was clear over the club, but fog could be seen in the east. Ivy and I set out for blind \#16. We had just passed the entrance to \#21 pond when I saw Mike McSweeny and Jim Koeppen signaling for help on the opposite side of the slough. Their motor had stalled. I towed them back to the dock. By this time the fog was almost over the club.

I finally reached my blind and was ready to shoot just before sunrise. As on Wednesday, the sea ducks were over and in my pond all morning. At one point they were joined by flocks of wildly flying teal and several times I held fire on teal assuming they were sea ducks and I fired two rounds at sea ducks hoping they might be teal. In mid-morning, I fired two rounds at a teal. It kept flying and then came down in the tulles 100 yards across the pond. Ivy swam over and scoured the area without result. Then she went a distance downwind, turned around and disappeared into the tulles. A few minutes later I stood up on the stool to look for her over the high cover but she was still out of sight. Then I heard a rustling in the reeds nest to my blind and Ivy emerged carrying the teal, which she delivered to hand.

The morning’s weather was unusual. A blanket of fog covered the south side of the club while the north side remained perfectly clear. And the wind, which at sunrise had been blowing briskly out the east, shifted to the north and then to the west.

I picked up at 9:45. My motor stalled on the way in but I managed to restart it. Tim Murphy and Mike Powell had worse luck. They were exploring the slough near Pelican Point when Tim took a corner a little too fast and ran their boat so far aground that four men were needed to pull it back into the water. And to cap off the morning, Chad Lyon’s dog “Patch” was sprayed by a skunk.

We had spaghetti with chioppino sauce for lunch.

Other: Eric Cushman was high Gun with a pintail, a mallard and a widgeon at blind \#12. Gary bagged a widgeon, making a total of five quarry ducks for the club on this morning.

Bag: One teal for four rounds fired. Ratio: 4:00 per-bird.

**December 26-30, 1996: Post Christmas Excursion**

I went to the club on Tuesday and stayed until through Saturday, a time that provided a wealth of experiences, most of them good, the others educational.

A vigorous storm was forecast for the afternoon and evening, with strong south winds. At 1:30, when I left the City, the first drops were falling; the rain was fairly heavy when I arrived at McAvoy. It let up at 4:00 o’clock, but a very strong wind was blowing out of the south. I was piloting the boat and decided to back out of the dock faster than usual to keep it under control in the wind. However, I misjudged the speed and brushed a column at the dock. I’m told the damage is repairable. After reaching the club and docking without further incident, I gave Ivy a short walk on which I saw a few flights of ducks.

Our party, Chris and Owen Charles, Richard Vaccari, Marc, Jim Koeppen, Mike Corsetti and I, enjoyed a dinner of turkey with all the trimmings, and chocolate cake for dessert.

The wind and rain continued through Tuesday night. By Wednesday morning the rain had passed but he wind had shifted to the west and was even stronger. I went to blind \#1 and because of the wind, secured my boat at the island. Also, because I’d observed that very windy days, ducks huddle together on dry land, I placed most of my mallard decoys on the island itself, with the remainder in the immediate lee.

There were storm clouds in the east and overhead, but the western sky was crystal clear. I started well, making a head shot on a teal that fell a few yards from the blind. Later, when a flight of widgeon passed overhead, I fired two shots. The ducks flew on and thinking I’d had missed, I turned around, reloaded and was looking down the pond when a widgeon splashed down in the water right next to the island. Ivy made a quick retrieve. What happened is that I’d actually hit the duck and it was too weak to continue flying into the wind, and so was blown back to my blind. I ended the morning badly, hitting a mallard that came down 50 yards northwest of the blind. The waves were too high for Ivy to see the duck and it dove and escaped.

Owen and Chris hunted in blind \#23; Owen bagged a gadwall. Jim Koeppen got two spoonies at blind \#4.

Marc and Mike were going home and because of the tide, we had to leave the club at 11:30. By this time the sky was clear but the wind was even stronger. The river was so rough that for safety’s sake we decided to leave the *Saint Germain* in the harbor and drive back to the club.

In the afternoon I went out to blind \#16 but saw very little action. I missed two shots at a pair of mallards at extreme range.

Frank arrived late in the afternoon. For dinner we had barbecued beef ribs with French fries and an ample salad. Dessert was a real treat, Chris’ homemade genuine mincemeat pie.

I’d rather forget Thursday morning, but doing so would cost me the benefit of a hard-learned lesson. I went back to blind \#16. The air was crystal clear and the wind, as strong as ever, was blowing out of the north. My results were abysmal, one lost duck for eight cartridges. Most of my shots were too long, although I did miss two at mallards that were overhead and looked to be well within range. On perfectly clear days, and especially windy ones, ducks appear to be much closer than they actually are. This lesson was forcefully brought home to me when I hit a mallard with my eighth and final round. I watched the duck fall and was certain that it was down in the pickleweed between the blind and the slough. In fact, Chris and Owen, who were shooting in blind \#15, saw the duck glide across the slough and come down in the boat ditch leading to their pond. Thus, I’d badly underestimated both the range of the shot and the distance the duck traveled after it was hit. Accordingly, on clear and windy days, I must either be *extremely* skeptical about range estimates or simply not bother going out.

Meanwhile, Frank and Jim Koeppen enjoyed some success at blind 12. Frank limited on pintail and got two teal plus a mallard in the afternoon. Jim got a widgeon.

At noontime Richard Vaccari drove home. My afternoon turned out to be as enjoyable as the morning had been disappointing. I passed up the hunt and spent the early hours reading in my room. At 3:20 I took Ivy out for a delightful walk on Division Line Road. The scenery was beautiful and there were plenty of ducks and geese to watch. At one point, literally thousands of ducks got up from the refuge to the east of us, an amazing sight. We stayed out almost two hours and I returned to the club refreshed and reinvigorated.

Jim Koeppen and I watched the Holiday Bowl and when the game was no longer in question, we dined on barbecued steak, baked potatoes and a big salad, with apple pie for dessert.

The overnight temperature was forecast to fall below freezing so Ivy slept next to my bed.

Friday dawned calm and clear under an almost transparent cover of high cloud. I slept in and then spent most of the morning in the club room recording my recent experiences. The others went out but came back with all their cartridges. In the afternoon I read for a while and then took Ivy out for a walk. There was only the slightest movement of air from the east. The ponds near the road were teeming with sea ducks but I saw only one mallard pair on the wing.

The Saturday hunters arrived in mid-afternoon. There were thirteen for dinner, which consisted of green salad with tomatoes and onions, boneless pork loin stuffed with mozzarella cheese, a nice gravy credit Gary Cushman, sautéed potatoes and green beans, and apple pie for dessert.

At blind picking time on Saturday, I opted for my perennial favorite, blind \#4. The morning was chilly, clear and hazy, with a light northeast wind. Except for the ever present sea ducks, almost nothing was flying and the day was one of the dullest in recent memory. Paradoxically, it also turned out to be one of the most satisfying. First, I felt right at home in my favorite blind and I put Thursday’s fiasco behind me. Second, I enjoyed a measure of success. When a flight of five teal flew over the pond, I called them in and, as they passed overhead, pivoted, focused on one, pivoted, mounted the gun and fired as it was going away, telling myself, “skeet, high one.” The duck fell by the entrance to the boat ditch and Ivy made a straightforward retrieve. Later, when a drake widgeon crossed about 40 yards to the east, a single shot brought it down in the ditch leading to pond \#3. I had some difficulty releasing Ivy from her tie-down and by the time she was on her way out, the duck had disappeared into the tulles. Ivy circled the reed patch, and then went in and was out of sight for a few minutes. When next seen, she was returning to the blind with the duck in her mouth.

We had chicken pot pie for lunch and left shortly afterward because of the tide.

Other: Jared and Eric Cushman shot in blind \#15 and bagged three teal. Everyone else drew a blank.

Four-day bag: two widgeon and two teal for 17 rounds fired. Per bird ratio: 4.25.

**Wednesday, January 3, 2007: A Spectacle of Sea Ducks**

Tuesday afternoon was dreary with a murky winter haze that obscured horizontal visibility and only the faintest breeze out of the east. We crossed the river at 2:30. Ivy and I took a leisurely walk out to the gate. Except for a multitude of sea ducks, our property was almost barren although I did see twenty widgeon get up from the Rich Island pond next to the road.

We dined on green salad, barbecued chicken, roast potatoes and broccoli with lemon cake for dessert.

I went to bed early. At 3:00 a.m. I looked out the window and saw fog so thick that it obscured the tree nearest to the house. I turned off my alarm clock. However, by 5:00 a.m., when I got up, a wind from the southwest had blown away the fog.

I went to blind \#4. I had only one opportunity, a drake mallard that came overhead at 40 yards. I was off balance and missed two shots. There were hundreds of sea ducks on the pond and they churned up the water as they moved from one end to the other. Shortly before 9:00, I saw thousands of sea ducks flying westward over the river in wave after wave. Rarely have I seen so many. A few quarry birds may have been among them but I didn’t see any, and I was using my field glasses.

We had chili, salad and pizza for lunch.

I was piloting the *Saint Germain* of the return crossing when the engine died. Mike Corsetti managed to restart it and we crept back to the dock. Harlan refueled the boat and primed the engine. We made it across the river but the engine died again as we were pulling into the dock at McAvoy.

Skunked for two rounds fired.

Mike Corsetti bagged six teal at blind \#12A and Rich Vaccari had some success at blind \#21. Everyone else got skunked.

**Saturday, January 6, 2007: Redemption at Blind \#16.**

Friday afternoon was so brilliantly clear that I could see the Sierras from the crest of the hill on the road to Bay Point. There was no wind, the *Saint Germain’s* motor problems had been sorted out and we enjoyed a smooth and uneventful crossing. I took a pre sunset walk with Ivy and saw only a few distant flocks in the air. However, about two hundred yards short of the gate I spied four mallards resting on out roadside pond. We turned around and went back.

Dinner was delayed until 8:00 o’clock. During the wait I went out to visit Ivy and was treated to the sight of the full moon shining through a veil of thin clouds as it rose over the eastern hills. We dined on salad, roast beef, polenta made with bleu cheese with mushroom gravy and sautéed Swiss chard. Our dessert was lemon cake and ice cream.

The nighttime temperature was expected to fall below freezing so I made suitable provisions for Ivy.

On Saturday morning a fresh wind was blowing out of the southwest. At Jim Koeppen’s suggestion I went to blind \# 16. The wind was ideal for that pond. I set my teal decoys in the lee of the island, put four pintail decoys 30 yards out in the pond, placed three pair of mallard near the shore of the bay upwind of the blind and put another pair in the bay to look as though they had just landed.

Nothing was flying at shooting time, but just as the sun was rising, the teal started coming. I began badly, missing two shots at each of my first two opportunities. Then I reloaded with no. 5. Tungsten Matrix to get a more open pattern (I’d started with no. 6 Hevi-Shot). Another flight of teal came to my call and I connected with my second shot. And after that, I hit everything I shot at. All four teal fell within 25 yards of the island, and Ivy had an easy time with them. Recalling my recent debacle at this blind, I passed up shots at the few mallards that came by at marginal range.

Most of the sea ducks had probably moved on; there were few of them in my vicinity. During the morning I observed very large flocks of ducks flying east to west over the river. I returned to the club well pleased with my results.

We had hot roast beef sandwiches with gravy for lunch.

Bag: four teal for nine rounds. Per-bird ratio: 2.25.

Jim Graziani and Mike Corsetti got three teal at blind \#12. Gary and Erik Cushman each got two teal and a widgeon at blind \#26.

**Wednesday, January 10, 2007: Ivy’s Busy Morning**

This hunt was all too short. Tuesday afternoon was a mild 65 degrees with a light wind from the northeast. We left McAvoy a little later than usual. The sun had almost set when Ivy and I set out on our customary walk. I saw two pair of mallards and only a few sea ducks.

Our dinner featured New York steaks perfectly barbecued by Mike Corsetti, accompanied by salad, baked potatoes, white corn and ice cream with chocolate sauce for dessert.

Wednesday morning was much colder. The wind had shifted to the southwest and strengthened; there a scattering of high clouds and a few wisps of low fog. I took Marc to blind \#12 and stationed him on the outer blind while I took the inner one. As I entered the boat ditch, scores of ducks got up. The sky was empty at shooting time but within a few minutes the ducks started flying and I shot a teal that came down in the pickleweed 40 yards north of the blind. Ivy went over, coursed back and fourth and soon found it. During the first hour Marc and I had fun calling in large flocks of wildly flying teal. I shot a second one that fell in the water 15 yards south of the blind. It started swimming and I fired a second shot that made it an easy retrieve for Ivy. At 8:00 o’clock gravel trucks started moving back and forth on Division Line Road and the action slowed down. Occasionally large ducks would approach but flare off just out of range. Shortly before 9:00, the widgeon started coming. Marc downed two; I missed two overhead shots at a widgeon because I stopped the gun. Ivy made six retrieves and but wasn’t able to find two other ducks that Marc brought down. We picked up at 9:15 because we needed to leave the club before noon due to the tide. I’m certain we would have gotten more ducks if we’d been able to stay out longer.

We had pizza for lunch and pulled away from the dock at 11:45.

Bag: two teal for five rounds. Ratio: 2.50.

Other: Marc’s two teal and two widgeon made him the day’s high Gun. Chris got a spoonie and a teal at blind \#16.

**Saturday, January 13, 2007: Sidelined**

An influx of frigid artic air dropped Friday’s temperature to the mid 40’s and a strong north wind made it feel even colder. We made a rough crossing under a crystal clear sky and docked at Wheeler Island because the very low tide. That’s when things went wrong for me. I had to jump out of the boat to the dock, landed badly and pulled a leg muscle. It didn’t bother me all that much during the one-half mile walk to the club but an hour or so later I could barely move. George Couch and Andy Stone put some ice on the spot and by dinner time I was able to walk short distances without too much pain.

We dined on bacon-wrapped barbecued doves stuffed with jalapeno peppers, wild rice and asparagus, with raspberry cake for dessert, a meal made all the more enjoyable by the presence of Chuck Yirchott, Mike Corsetti’s guest. I brought Ivy inside just after sunset because the temperature was dropping fast.

My leg was still hurting in the morning and the thought of wading on a muddy pond bottom held no appeal, so I stayed in and rested. The morning was absolutely clear but the wind had died down. The ponds were coated with ice and it stayed cold all morning. From my vantage point at the clubhouse I didn’t see any ducks in the air but did hear an occasional shot. The hunters who went out enjoyed only modest success. Jim Koeppen and Jim Jr. bagged two pintails at blind \#12 and Jim Graziani doubled on mallards at blind \#7. Mike Corsetti and Chuck got skunked at blind \#10.

We had a rich and delicious lunch, linguine Alfredo for with leftover dove and bacon added to the sauce.

The rest paid off because I was feeling better in the afternoon and much better on Sunday.

**Wednesday, January 17, 2007: Ducks Aplenty**

Tuesday afternoon was cool and clear, with a light east wind. We crossed the river at 2:00 o’clock. When we arrived we saw spoonies and widgeon resting on the house pond. On our walk I saw a few mallard pairs settling into the area next to \#1 pond and later watched from a safe distance as a skunk crossed the road opposite the boat repair shed.

At sunset a rank of clouds in the northwest was moving toward us and some rain fell during the night.

We had a very nicely cooked corned beef and its usual accompaniments for dinner. The cabbage was sautéed with pieces of bacon, a tasty change. The forecast of freezing temperatures prompted me to bring Ivy inside.

By morning the sky had cleared and a fresh wind was blowing from the southwest. I went to blind \#16 and set my mallard decoys as on my last hunt. However, I put my pintail decoys 40 yards out from the blind, a decision I would come to regret. Nothing was flying at shooting time but shortly before sunrise a pair of wing-set widgeon came in. I dropped the drake with one shot and Ivy made an easy retrieve. A little later, another pair of widgeon passed to the north at 45 yards; I missed my first shot but connected with my second one. It fell in the pond about 60 yards away and was still swimming but Ivy caught it and brought it in.

Shortly before 8:00, gravel trucks started moving on Division Line Road and the marsh virtually exploded with ducks. That’s when things went downhill for me. For the next half-hour there were ducks to the left of me, ducks to the right of me and ducks overhead, but my shooting skill vanished. I fired another twelve cartridges without effect except for a few feathers from a rapidly departing teal and worse, another teal that was lightly hit that came down on the pond but vanished in the reeds before Ivy could catch it. In sum the morning gave me equal measure of excitement and frustration. Looking back, I think one part of my problem was overexcitement and another was that my pintail decoys were so far away from the blind that any ducks they drew came over out of range.

We had corned beef hash for lunch, entirely fitting considering the hash I’d made of the morning’s hunt.

Other: Frank Fiala and Jim Koeppen limited at blind \#12. Marc bagged a teal at blind \#15 and Jim Graziani got skunked at blind \#10.

**Wednesday, January 24, 2007: Another Disappointing Performance**

Tuesday afternoon was clear but hazy, with very little wind. We crossed the river at 4:00 o’clock and upon arrival, were greeted by the sight of mallard, pintail, widgeon and spoonies on the house pond. I tested my motor and found it was not discharging any water and so I could not use my boat. Ivy and I took a shorter than usual walk but didn’t see anything worth noting.

We had meat loaf for dinner with green salad, mashed potatoes and peas, and lemon cheesecake for dessert.

On Wednesday morning the air was damp and hazy. Chris and I went out in his boat to blind \#7. There was very little wind. Some teal were flying at shooting time on Chris’ side of the blind. A goose came into range but Chris held fire thinking that it might turn and give both of us a chance to shoot at it. It didn’t. Two mallards flew into the decoys behind us. I didn’t seem them until they lifted of. They turned flew back toward us at 45-50 yards range. I fired two shots but they kept going, but one of them may have been hit lightly. It came down near Division Line Road, another addition to me my already overlong list of lost ducks. Later I missed a shot at a mallard that crossed in front of the blind. Chris thought it was out of range.

We had a choice of chicken pot pie or meat load sandwiches for lunch.

Because of the low tide, we spent a leisurely afternoon at the club and didn’t leave until 4:00 o’clock

Bag: skunked for three rounds fired.

**Friday & Saturday, January 26-27, 2007: Season’s End**

This hunt was a reprise of many of my experiences during the season, i.e., a scarcity of ducks, a balky motor and nondescript weather. Its redeeming features were an especially enjoyable dinner and, for a welcome change, effective shooting on my part.

Because of the tide, we crossed the river at 11:30 on Friday. At that time the sky was cloudless and hazy, and the wind light and variable. We made our own sandwiches at the club. The Board of Directors had an early afternoon meeting after which we went hunting. My motor was running once again, though not perfectly. I wanted to conclude the season in my favorite blind, and went to blind \#4. As I approached the blind, quite a few ducks flew off, including a pair of mallards that had been sitting on the island. A moderate wind was blowing out of the northeast and a bank of mid-level clouds was approaching from the northwest. I had only one opportunity when a teal came to the call and set down near my decoys. One shot was followed by an easy retrieve.

I picked up a few minutes before sunset and made it back to the dock without incident. Dinner was one of the season’s best, featuring buffalo *osso bucco,* mashed potatoes and sautéed broccoli with raspberry torte for dessert, followed by Seven-Star Metaxa brandy contributed by George Couch.

I’d left my decoys in the pond and so could go out later in the morning and still be ready by shooting time. It had rained during the night and the departing front could be seen to the east. To the west, the sky was clear but hazy with the wind light and variable. Very few ducks were flying. I passed up a pair of mallards that came by just out of range. Later, thinking they were sea ducks, I failed to recognize some teal that sped over the decoys and were quickly away.

A few drops of rain were falling as, with little regret, I picked up my decoys for the last time. Most of the ducks had already moved on and it was time for me to do likewise. My motor faltered on the way in and even at full throttle was barely turning over. Fortunately, as I was limping along past the \#23 boat ditch, it caught and I was able to run in at normal speed.

We made our own sandwiches and again because of the tide, we departed the club before noon.

Bag: One teal for one cartridge.

**Postscript**

My harvest for the season came to six mallards, six widgeon, twelve teal, one spoonie and one goldeneye. This represents a fifty percent improvement over last year. My final cartridge per bird ratio of 3.85 is decline from the previous season’s 3.11. This regression is clearly attributable my hideous performance on two hunts. One area of concern is the five ducks lost, at least two of which of which resulted from shooting too far. I resolve to do better next year.

After the season I took my motor to a new mechanic. After a lengthy test, he finally found the cause of my troubles, a faulty ignition control chip, which he replaced. He also gave it the routine service and a tune-up. I can’t predict how the shooting will be this fall but I am looking forward to a season of trouble-free boating.

A happy off-season to all.
