**Introduction: The Cat that Saved a Duck Club**

Sherlock Holmes solved *The Case of the Silver Blaze* because a dog failed to bark. Truth proved to be as strange as fiction on a windy Saturday night in late July, when Harlan’s cat Rosie saved our club by not coming in at the usual time.

It happened this way. Harlan usually lets Rosie come in before he goes to bed, but that night he awoke from a sound sleep at 12:30 and realized that she was till outside. He got up, opened his door and was shocked to see the clubroom fully engulfed in flames. He hadn’t heard anything because the west wind was blowing so hard that it drowned out all other sounds. Fortunately the club has a high pressure pump and a fire hose that Harlan used to extinguish the fire, just as the flames were reaching the deck by the plucking area. The fire trucks arrived from Fairfield much later. The clubroom burned to the ground and had Rosie come in at the normal time, it’s likely that the rest of the club would also have been lost. Incidentally, one of the responding trucks went off the road and into the marsh.

On a positive note, in late summer we achieved a long sought goal, the installation of a new gate into \#28 pond in order to improve the water quality on the east side of the club.

**October 20, 2007: A Satisfying Opening Day**

Friday morning’s weather was unusual; intermittent light showers with sunny periods, temperatures in the mid 60’s and a vigorous wind from the southwest.

We left McAvoy at 11:00 a.m. with Steve Martinelli at the helm of the *St. Germain.* During the crossing Les Vaccari’s hat blew off, but thanks to some skillful boat handling on Steve’s part, it was pulled from the water, soaked but otherwise intact.

I spent much of the afternoon getting my boat ready with Jim Graziani’s much appreciated help. When the motor was installed, I started it with some trepidation, recalling my woes of the previous season. It initially sputtered and died a few times, but afterward didn’t miss a beat, during my test runs and on Saturday. On my late afternoon walk with Ivy, I saw only a few ducks on or over our club, but quite a number on Rich Island’s pond next to the road.

Richard Everhart, our new cook, started well, serving a mixed green salad, New York strip cooked to perfection in Wheeler Island’s smoker, baked potatoes, sautéed asparagus and lemon cake with ice cream. The accompanying wines were quite drinkable.

Some rain fell during the night but by 4:45 a.m. the front had moved to the east and it was clear in the west. I saw a meteor flash across the sky. The temperature had dropped and the wind had shifted to the west. I drew a middling blind pick and went to blind \#4, although I knew the wind’s direction was less than ideal.

We had flooded late and the water level was lower than usual. The wind was so strong that my decoys were blown out of position. I was ready by shooting time and within ten minutes I had a drake mallard on my strap, hit solidly with my second shot at forty yards and easily retrieved by Ivy. There were plenty of ducks were in the air, including quite a few teal and an abundance of spoonies. I took four shots at ducks at marginal range but failed to connect. The variety of clouds in the sky and the scenic surroundings plus the number of ducks in the air made the morning especially pleasurable.

I picked up and came in at 9:00 o’clock in order to catch the noon boat to McAvoy.

Other shooters did fairly well. Jim Graziani and Mike Corsetti got a mixed bag of twelve mallard, pintail and teal. Mike Powell and Ryan Murphy got fourteen ducks between them but half were spoonies. Gary and Erik Cushman got six ducks in blind \#26; Gary commented on how much better the water looked. George Couch drew a blank at \#10. Les Vaccari and Steve Martinelli got four ducks at blind \#7.

Sunday morning’s hunting was much slower, with twenty being the total take. Jim Graziani went to blind \#4 and bagged a gadwall. He said hardly anything was flying. Chris and Owen went to blind \#26 and got one teal.

Bag: One mallard for six cartridges.

**Wednesday, October 24: One Never Really Knows**

When Marc Pasquini and I left the City on Tuesday afternoon, we weren’t particularly optimistic. The afternoon’s heat and lack of wind were forecast to continue through Wednesday. We crossed the river at 3:00 o’clock. I shortened my customary walk with Ivy because of the warm weather plus the mosquitoes; I saw only a few ducks in the far distance.

During the cocktail hour we sat out on the porch by the picking shed overlooking our clubroom’s now bare concrete foundation and watching a nearly full moon rising over the eastern hills. At dusk the mosquitoes chased us inside.

Dinner was excellent; a mixed salad followed by home-made meatloaf (Richard’s recipe includes Italian sausage) mashed potatoes with brown gravy and string beans sautéed with garlic, followed by ice cream with chocolate syrup. After dinner, as I was packing my gear for the morning’s hunt, I felt an earthquake.

When I went out to wake Ivy at 4:30 on Wednesday morning, the sky was clear with only the slightest movement of air from the north. I picked blind \#16. On the way out on Noyce Slough, the new Barbour hat I’d bought in London blew off and sank before I could find it. I went back for another hat and wasn’t ready to shoot until twenty minutes after shooting time. Shortly before sunrise a drake teal came by a fairly close range. I fired one round of my new one ounce no. \#6 bismuth ammunition. It proved to be an ideal load for teal. Ivy was out and back in a flash. Later I fired a shot at a mallard hen at marginal range without effect. Around 8:00, a pair of teal raced by going east to west. I called them back, fired at the hen and it fell 30 yards out in the pond. Ivy made a routine retrieve. I spent the rest of the morning looking at a mostly empty sky, although I did seem a decent number of ducks that were well out of range.

We had meat loaf sandwiches for lunch.

Jim Graziani also lost his hat in the slough. Our six hunters bagged nine quarry ducks and two spoonies.

Bag: two teal for three rounds.

**Saturday October 27, 2007: Autumn Arrives**

On Friday afternoon we crossed the river at 4:00 o’clock. The cool fresh wind blowing out of the west and a sky partially covered with high clouds convinced me that fall had arrived with winter soon to follow. The change in the weather invigorated me and I stayed out with Ivy for forty-five minutes, but saw only a scattering ducks at extreme distance.

I was pleased to see Steve Lyon, who came to the club as the guest of his son Chad. Dinner commenced with an artichoke and lettuce salad, then roast pork with home-made brown gravy that was very tasty, roasted potatoes, sautéed chard (a favorite of mine) and pumpkin pie with whipped cream for dessert.

At 5:00 a.m. the full moon was shining through a cover of high clouds and the wind was out of the southwest at 8-10 mph. I had first choice and invited George Couch and his Labrador Buster to join us at blind \#12. George and Buster took the outer island called “the point” and Ivy and I the inner one. Fifteen minutes after shooting time, a flight of widgeon passed to the south of me. I fired one of my teal loads and a drake came down in the pond. Still very lively, it swam and dove for a while until Ivy was able to catch it and bring it to hand. The lesson is that the one ounce bismuth loads are ideal for teal, but even medium size ducks may need a heavier shot charge.

This was the sum of the morning’s action in our corner of the club. We saw a few flocks flying east to west at least 250 yards high and after 8:30 the sky was empty. George didn’t fire a single shot. Meanwhile, 400 yards to the north of us in blind \#15, Andy Stone enjoyed a stellar morning, bagging three mallards and a widgeon. Tim Murphy shot a pair of mallards at blind \#17 - the first ducks taken at that blind. Mike Corsetti got two teal at blind \#23.

We had a hearty lunch of spaghetti and meat balls with garlic bread and left the club at 1:00 o’clock. The wind was still blowing and the crossing was rougher than usual.

Bag: one widgeon for one round fired.

**Wednesday, October 31: Lester’s Halloween Treat**

Tuesday afternoon was mild, hazy, with a west wind strong enough to make the crossing noticeably rough. Les, Lou, Marc and I arrived at the Club at 3:20.

The others went out for an afternoon hunt. I stayed in and took Ivy for a walk along Mud Slough. Using my binoculars, I could see hundreds of ducks flying over the refuge some miles to the east. I saw no ducks over our property but the others did, and to their benefit. Les and Lou bagged two mallards at blind \#15 and Marc got one at blind \#21.

We dined on salad with ranch dressing, baked ham, yams, broccoli with melted cheese and home made banana cream pie for dessert. I brought a bottle of 2005 Jadot Pouilly-Fuisse that was well received.

On Wednesday morning there was a cover of high fog and the wind was still out of the west. I went to the inner island at \#12. There were quite a few ducks flying during the first hour but the only ones that came well within range a flock of teal that skimmed the pond on Ivy’s side of the blind. I held fire, not wanting to shoot over her. I expended a total of five rounds at three marginal chances without effect and went in at 10:00 0’clock.

The morning turned was a treat for Les and Lou; they went back to blind \#15 and got three more mallards, a pintail and a teal. Marc went to \#23 and downed a mallard, but couldn’t find it.

We had chicken pot pie from Costco for lunch and crossed back to McAvoy at 2:00 o’clock.

Bag: skunked for five rounds fired.

**Saturday, November 3, 2007: Warm Weather Hunting**

The fog that covered my neighborhood on Friday morning extended into San Francisco Bay with the top of the fog bank just reaching the lower deck of the Bay Bridge. At McAvoy Harbor, the temperature was in the mid 70’s with a light wind out of the northeast. We crossed the river at 1:00 p.m.

Ivy and I took a mid-afternoon walk but both of us were harassed by the mosquitoes. A very large number of ducks were flying over the closed zone to the east of us and too far to be seen with the naked eye. However, we did see a few ducks flying over our own property.

Dinner commenced with green salad, then roast chicken with mushroom gravy, rice and asparagus and vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup for dessert.

At 5:15 on Saturday morning, Ivy’s wake-up time, the air was clear and perfectly calm. I went to blind \#16 and spent the morning as an armed bird watcher, observing the seagulls and marsh hawks, and returned to the dock with all my cartridges.

Two incidents saved my morning from total uneventfulness. The first occurred a little past 8:00 when a teal flew by. I called and it flew back directly toward me and then made two tight circles about 10 feet over my head, much too close to shoot; then it dropped below the cover and sped off across the pond. A little later I was scanning the Napa Hills with my field glasses and saw clouds of ducks flying around. I’d never seen so many ducks in that area.

I picked up at 9:00 o’clock. We had Reuben sandwiches for lunch.

The morning’s total bag for the club was four, a mallard, two teal and a spoonie.

**Wednesday, November 7, 2007: Glorious Success**

Tuesday afternoon gave me reason to hope. The day was clear with a brisk west wind and at 3:20, when we arrived at the club, there were ducks resting on the house pond. Ivy and I set out on our usual walk to the gate but turned back when several mallards lifted off the pond next to the road. We walked a short distance on the road to Wheeler Island and I counted twenty-five ducks on our neighbors’ pond.

Dinner was especially good: artichoke salad, perfectly cooked leg of lamb with mint sauce, baked potatoes and green beans, and pecan pie with whipped cream for dessert. After dinner we scanned the sky and observed the newly bright Comet Holmes.

The clock was back on standard time so I rose at 4:00 a.m. The wind was still blowing from the west but there was a low fog, most unusual in a west wind. Horizontal visibility was about one hundred and fifty yards. However, I saw the morning star when I looked up.

I had a high pick and at Jim Koeppen’s suggestion, chose the inner island at \#12 pond. I ran out at reduced speed because of the fog, and wasn’t ready to shoot until about half an hour after shooting time. A few minutes later as I was gazing to the north, a duck materialized out of the fog. I fired and it fell in the grass about fifty yards east of the blind. Ivy bought it to hand. To my delight it was a hen pintail. A little later, another duck came out of the fog, crossing to the west. One shot brought it down about twenty yards out in the pond. Ivy was instantly out and back with a fine drake mallard. With two prime ducks on my strap I decided to relax and enjoy the morning. The fog gradually lifted. A little before 8:00 I missed three shots at passing widgeon, thus spoiling my perfect average. Before long however, another drake mallard came to my decoys; one shot brought it down right next to the island.

Despite the fact that I was having remarkable luck, the sky was virtually empty with very few ducks to be seen. I had intended to pick up and go in at 9:00 but when the time came I decided to stay out a little longer. This was a lucky decision. At 9:05, a hen mallard came to the decoys and flew past at 35 yards range. I missed my first shot but connected with the second and Ivy made a routine retrieve. When she brought it in, I decided to put period this extraordinary morning that had seen me bag four prime ducks for eight cartridges.

Lou Flanders got a mallard at blind \#7; Jim Koeppen likewise at blind \#21 and Ed Graziani got two diving ducks at blind \#15.

We made our own sandwiches for lunch from a nice spread of cold meats.

**Saturday, November 10, 2007: A Slow Day**

The forecast called for showers during Friday night and rain on Saturday afternoon. However, the sky was clear on Friday afternoon with only a few high clouds and a west wind. I was skeptical about the forecast. I took Ivy for a twilight walk but didn’t see any ducks.

Dinner was a standout: salad, poached wild salmon (contributed by Jim Koeppen) white and wild rice and perfectly baked asparagus; dessert was apple pie *a la mode.*

At 5:00 a.m. on Saturday the sky was partially covered with mid-level clouds and there was only the slightest movement of air from the south. I went to blind \#4 and had an uneventful morning, the highlight of which was missing one shot at a high crossing duck. There were very few ducks flying. Meanwhile the sky grew darker and a light wind began to blow from the south. I picked up at 9:30 and when I reached the dock, a very light rain was falling.

We had linguini Alfredo for lunch. Our nine hunters brought in a “grand” total of six ducks, one mallard, one gadwall two teal and two spoonies.

Bag: skunked for one round fired.

**Wednesday, November 14, 2007: The Slowdown Continues**

Tuesday afternoon was clear with virtually no wind making for a smooth 4:00 o’clock crossing. When we arrived twenty-five or so mallards were taking their ease on the far side of the house pond. However, when I took Ivy on our customary walk along the road, the only ducks I saw were flying well to the east of the club.

Dinner featured roast beef with home made gravy, roasted potatoes, chard sautéed with garlic and pie *a la mode* for dessert.

At 5:00 a.m. on Wednesday the sky was clear with a light breeze out of the east. Jim Koeppen’s advice on the previous Wednesday had culminated in a triumphant morning and so I followed it again and this time went to blind \#16. This time I was not so fortunate. I spent the morning gazing into a mostly empty sky but did fire two ineffective shots at a mallard that appeared to be within range. Jim, who was hunting with his son in blind \#15, said it was no closer than 60 yards.

During the morning a fresh wind came up from the north. The scenery was pretty. Mike Corsetti and Marc Pasquini enjoyed some success in \#12 pond. Mike bagged a hen mallard and a widgeon and Marc, a large mallard drake. Les Vaccari and Lou Flanders teamed up in blind \#7 to get one mallard.

We made our own sandwiches from thinly sliced left over roast beef and left the club at 1:00 o’clock.

**Saturday, November 17, 2007: Not an Idle Moment**

This outing featured a host of experiences compressed into a short time frame. We departed McAvoy Harbor at 4:00 o’clock on Friday under a mostly cloudy sky with a fresh wind from the west. I gave Ivy a short walk, packed my gear for Saturday morning and then headed to Rich Island for the annual Marsh Party. About fifty guests were in attendance. After cocktails we dined on, grilled flank steak, Caesar salad, roast red potatoes, fresh peas and carrot cake for dessert. I particularly enjoyed sharing experiences with the members of neighboring clubs, one of whom told of hunting on the bay for scaup, popularly known as bluebills. He described them as “baby canvasbacks.” When he said they were good eating, I was intrigued.

About 8:30 Gary Cushman and I thanked out hosts and shared an enjoyable mile’s walk back to the club. The west wind was still blowing and the half moon was intermittently obscured by the racing clouds.

Similar conditions prevailed on Saturday morning. I went to blind \#4 and was ready by shooting time. The wind was a few more points to the west than would have been ideal but the sky was pretty and the sunrise dramatic. Shortly after sunrise a drake mallard passed in front of the blind at 25 yards height. I fired one round of no. \#6 bismuth. It came down about sixty yards south of the island and swam into the reeds. Ivy swam over and started coursing back and forth in front of the reed patch. Then she went into the reeds and I saw her freeze for an instant. Then she turned toward me. Is there any more beautiful sight than a retriever emerging from the tulles carrying a large duck? A little later one shot brought down a bluebill out of a flock that sped past the blind. Ivy made an easy retrieve.

I missed a shot at a mallard at marginal range. I picked up my decoys at 8:15; we were in a hurry to leave because of the dropping tide. We beat the tide and by 10:30 were entering to mouth of McAvoy Harbor. But for me the day held one more experience. In the middle of the afternoon I boned out the bluebill and marinated it in blend of teriyaki sauce, Basque Marinade and chopped garlic. That evening I cooked it on the electric grill and ate it with wild rice. Harlan had advised me to use tartar sauce but its flavor was not at all strong and with a little steak sauce, quite enjoyable, and well accompanied with a 1993 E. Guigal Cotes du Rhone.

Bag: One mallard and one bluebill for three cartridges, ratio, 1.50.

**Wednesday, November 21, 2007: Ivy Comes Through . . . Again!**

On Tuesday afternoon we left McAvoy Harbor at 1:00 o’clock and enjoyed a fairly smooth crossing. The weather was mild, the sky clear with a little haze and there was a light west wind. Ivy and I took an hour’s walk; we saw some ducks fly off Rich Island, but very few over our club. Afterward, I rested in my room until cocktail time.

Our dinner menu was green salad, grilled pork chops with mushroom gravy, mashed potatoes, peas and carrots and pecan pie for dessert. I contributed a bottle of Tuscan wine, a 2003 Ruffino “Il Ducale” that was well received.

Wednesday morning dawned clear with a light southwest wind. The haze was gone and the scenery was particularly enjoyable set against a sky decorated with cirrus clouds. I went to blind \#15. A little after sunrise a hen mallard crossed about 40 yards to the west of my blind. One shot brought it down about 60 yards in the direction of the boat ditch. As Ivy went out to get it, the duck swam into the ditch, and it covered another 40 yards before Ivy caught up with it. I watched it dive once or twice but Ivy stayed with it and brought it to hand, another outstanding retrieve. I missed two shots at small ducks that sped by my island. It’s probably just as well because while they could have been teal, they probably were diving ducks. I also missed one overhead shot at a mallard.

After a hurried lunch of pastrami and cheese sandwiches we departed the club at 12:15.

Bag: one mallard for four cartridges. Ratio 4.00 per bird.

**Wednesday, November 28, 2007: A Spectacle and a Scare**

I thought that in my twenty-six years hunting on the marsh, I’d seen everything, but I was wrong. On this hunt I had an extraordinary experience and, to my embarrassment, relearned a basic lesson of firearms safety.

When crossed the river on Tuesday at 4:00 0’clock, the sky was clear and a fresh wind was blowing out of the east. Harlan said there were more than a few ducks on our ponds (he didn’t say what kind) and on my sunset walk with Ivy, the sight of mallards flying off the pond next to the road prompted me to turn around about 300 yards short of the gate.

Our dinner featured leg of lamb with roasted potato wedges and sautéed chard, with lemon cake and ice cream for dessert.

On Wednesday morning, the sky was clear and the wind was blowing from the northeast. I went to blind \#16 and was treated to an amazing show that started just after shooting time and continued for two hours. Flocks of diving ducks numbering in the hundreds covered the sky as they flew over and around my island. They would occasionally land in the lee end of the pond and, after a few minutes rest, get up and fly around again. I’ve never seen anything like this. Paradoxically, only a few quarry ducks appeared, although a pair of widgeon did come down on the far side of the pond. Normally even on slow mornings one sees flocks of big ducks flying at high altitude. This day, there were none to be seen, even with binoculars.

And now for the lesson. When it is time to go in, I unload my gun, pull the trigger to relieve the pressure on the trigger spring, and put it in its case. This morning, I forgot to unload my gun, and when I pulled the trigger, it went off. Fortunately, I was pointing it in a safe direction. The lesson is obvious, when handling firearms you have to think *all the time.*

I motored back to the dock not a little nonplussed. On the way in, I stopped at \#12 pond where Ivy searched for a pintail that Jim Koeppen had brought down; she covered a large area of reeds but couldn’t find it. Frank Fiala, who hunted in the inner blind, was high Gun with two drake mallards.

We had chicken pot pie for lunch and left the club at 1:15.

**Saturday, December 1, 2007: Steve’s Dismal Day**

This was another compressed outing. Friday afternoon’s low tide kept us in McAvoy Harbor until 4:30. The sky was clear with a brisk wind from the west. Ivy and I took a short walk and once again, we turned around when we saw mallards flying off the pond by the road.

We dined on roast rock Cornish game hens, polenta with mushroom gravy, asparagus sautéed with garlic and for dessert, cheese cake with strawberry topping.

Saturday morning was clear; the wind had shifted to the southwest and was blowing steadily at 8-10 mph. I went to blind \#4 and was ready a few minutes after shooting time. There were diving ducks around my blind for most of the morning but hardly any quarry ducks to be seen. However, at 7:45 a pair of mallards came down the boat ditch about 20 yards high. I crouched down in the barrel and as they passed over head, fired at the trailing duck and hit it solidly. I watched it fall dead in the water instead of trying for the leading bird. Ivy made an easy retrieve. About 8:15, I spied a flock of wildly flying teal. I called them and as they passed overhead, snapped off a shot and watched one fall in the tulles next to the boat ditch. Ivy made a heroic effort but couldn’t find it. I immediately picked up and started back to the dock because we were planning to leave the club before noon, again because of the tide.

I was passing the entrance to blind \#3 when I noticed Steve Martinelli on the opposite side of the slough standing in his boat waving for help. As I approached I saw that his boat didn’t have a motor. Steve told me that he’d taken Richard Vaccari to blind \#26 and was on his way to his own blind when the outboard motor fell off his boat. This was his spare motor; his regular one had overheated when he started it. I towed Steve back to the dock and let him borrow my boat to go pick up Richard.

It’s commonly said that the worst day hunting is better than the best day working. After his morning’s travails, Steve would likely disagree.

We skipped lunch in order to beat the tide and were away from the club a little after noon.

Overall, the morning was slow but a few good ducks were brought in. Frank Fiala got a sprig at blind \#12 and Chris, his partner got two mallards. Gary Cushman and his guest bagged a pair of mallards at blind \#28. Andy Stone and George Couch got skunked at blind \#15.

Bag: One mallard for two rounds fired, one duck lost

**Wednesday, December 6, 2007: Ivy’s Discriminating Taste**

On Tuesday afternoon Marc, Ivy and I drove to McAvoy Harbor through low fog in some places and hazy sunshine in others. Our departure, originally scheduled for 3:00 o’clock, took place at 2:25 because of the rapidly dropping tide. Even so, we barely made it into our dock at the club. When we arrived, Harlan said there were more than a few ducks on the property and I observed a dozen or so large ducks resting on the far side of the house pond.

Ivy and I took an hour’s walk. The temperature was cool with a light west wind and high fog. There were more ducks to be seen that at any recent time. I was hopeful for the morning. Dinner featured barbecued New York steaks, roasted potatoes with brown gravy and ratatouille, with cheesecake for dessert.

On Wednesday morning the fog had lowered, reducing visibility to about 500 yards and as on Saturday, the wind had shifted to the southwest. I went to blind \#4 and was ready at shooting time, but the fog made it very dark. No matter, except for the numerous diving ducks, nothing was flying. The fog lifted around 9:00 o’clock making the setting more cheerful but doing nothing for the duck count. At 9:15, a widgeon landed in the pond. When it swam within 50 yards of the island, I fired over its head, but missed two more shots as it flew off. I should have let it come in closer.

As I was picking up, Ivy swam 400 yards over to blind \#7, where Les and Lou Flanders were hunting. They tried to give her a spoonie to bring back to me, but she would have nothing to do with it.

We had lasagna for lunch and left at 1:15 p.m.

The total count for the club was three mallards and three spoonies.

Bag: skunked for three rounds fired.

**Wednesday, December 12, 2007: An Empty but Beautiful Sky**

Tuesday afternoon was so clear that the Sierras could easily be seen from the rise on Highway \#4. The temperature was cool and the wind was from the east. Marc and I reached McAvoy well before the scheduled 4:00 o’clock departure so I gave Ivy a long walk around the harbor.

When we docked at the club, Harlan said the ducks on the property the “smart ones.” Ivy and I took a short sunset walk during which I saw several hundred diving ducks in the bay opposite the Division Road junction, but very few quarry ducks.

Dinner was a standout: fresh cracked crab followed by barbecued chicken, potatoes sautéed with onion, green beans and cheesecake for dessert. Freezing temperatures were forecast so Ivy slept beside my bed.

Wednesday morning was cold, with mid-level clouds covering much of the sky and a light wind out of the north. At sunrise, the clouds took on a variety hues and from my vantage point at blind \#4 I enjoyed the scenic delights. My one opportunity when what looked by a teal flew overhead. I missed because I didn’t give it enough lead. Otherwise, except for the diving ducks that occasionally sped by, the sky was empty. On many slow mornings, one can enjoy the sight of large flocks of ducks flying high above the marsh. Not this day, although several hundred geese flew over Division Line Road about 250 yards high as I was picking up.

On the way in, I stopped at blind \#10 to see whether Jim Koeppen and Marc needed any dog work. Jim said a crippled mallard had gone into dry land between the pond and Noyce Slough. Ivy searched it thoroughly but failed to find it. On the drive home, Marc told me it was really a spoonie.

The total bag for our seven hunters was one pintail (Mike Corsetti at \#12) and one spoonie (Marc at \#10). We had grilled ham and cheese sandwiches with French fries for lunch.

Bag: skunked for one round fired.

**Saturday, December 15, 2007: Winter One Week Early**

According to the calendar winter begins on the 21st of December but this hunt was as gloomy as any winter day can be. On Friday afternoon a cover of grey haze hung over the marsh cutting horizontal visibility to about ten miles. There was no more than the faintest of breezes out of the east and on out 4:00 o’clock crossing, the river was mirror smooth. Ivy and I set out on our walk as soon as we arrived; there were hardly any ducks to be seen but the sunset was beautiful.

Dinner was especially good: barbecued pork chops stuffed with herbs and cheese, polenta with a red and green bell pepper sauce, sautéed chard and chocolate cake for dessert.

Freezing temperatures were not in the forecast so after dinner I dressed Ivy in her neoprene coat, gave her a good-night biscuit and settled her in her kennel. The air felt damp and I suspected that there would be fog in the morning. There was fog in the morning, but not at ground level. The ceiling was about 250 yards with two miles of horizontal visibility. A cold wind was blowing out of the southwest at 5 mph.

I went to blind \#4 and was ready a few minutes after shooting time. A teal landed in the pond 18 yards from my blind. Unquestionably, one is entitled to the fruits of his fieldcraft and the teal would have been an easy shot if it hadn’t been directly in front of one of my decoys. I decided that a duck on my strap wasn’t worth the embarrassment of coming in with a shot- riddled decoy. The teal lifted off and I raised my gun but it escaped because I’d neglected to take off the safety. The rest of my morning was spent watching the seagulls and diving ducks while becoming increasingly cold. I picked up at 9:10 and brought all of my cartridges back to the dock.

We had giant hamburgers for lunch. A few of our hunters enjoyed some success. Chris Charles was high Gun at blind \#11 with a mallard and a teal. Jim Graziani got a mallard and two goldeneye at blind \#1; Steve Martinelli bagged a mallard at blind \#15.

Bag: skunked for no rounds fired.

**Tuesday & Wednesday, December 18-19, 2007: A Dearth of Ducks**

The results of this hunt can be summarized very briefly. Six hunters spent Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning sitting out under partly cloudy but otherwise empty skies. The “grand” total for both days was four: a mallard by Lou Flanders at blind \#7, a gadwall by Marc Pasquini at the outer blind at \#12 pond and two spoonies by Chris Charles at blind \#11. Rain had fallen on Monday and Tuesday morning. I spent the time at blind \#4. The scenery was pretty but distressingly, there were almost no ducks in the air, even at high altitude

Tuesday’s dinner was the highlight of this outing. Following the customary pre prandial libations, we sat down to green salad with Roma tomatoes and ranch dressing, meat loaf with brown gravy, mashed potatoes and peas, and hot apple pie for dessert. The food impressed me as just about perfect for a marshland setting in the middle of winter. As a bonus, we had meat loaf sandwiches for lunch on Wednesday.

Bag: skunked for no rounds fired.

**Saturday, December 22, 2007: Perfectly Calm**

Friday afternoon was extremely clear with no wind. When we arrived at the dock, we found fresh seafood in the *St. Germain’s* locker for Chippino night. Jim Graziani had purchased it in Napa and brought it to the duck; then he turned around and drove home because he wasn’t feeling well. We crossed the river at one o’clock. I took a long walk with Ivy. I didn’t see any ducks but thought I saw a coyote in the distance.

Jim Graziani is an accomplished Chippino chef and we missed his expertise. Nevertheless the dinner was successful. Harlan had started the sauce and it was simmering when we arrived. Later, several members contributed their suggestions and the final result was a good as always.

It remained calm on Saturday morning. Thanks to the partial cloud cover, the sunrise was beautiful. Otherwise, the morning’s hunt followed the recent pattern. Mike Corsetti and I went to blind \#12. Except for a few high-flying flocks the sky was empty. Shortly after dawn, I fired at and missed a duck that Mike said was probably out of range. Some time later, a pair of large diving ducks raced past my blind. I fired at one and it flew about 150 yards before coming down in a pond to the north of my island. Ivy went out and hunted the area thoroughly but she failed to find it.

On the way in, my motor ran poorly and I asked Harlan to check the sparkplugs.

We had beef tamales for lunch.

Bag: skunked for two rounds fired; one duck lost.

**Wednesday, December 26 – Saturday December 29: A Chilly Post-Christmas  Excursion**

As is our custom, the club was open from Christmas day until the Sunday after New Year’s Day. Accordingly at 1:15 on Wednesday afternoon, Chris and Owen Charles, Erik Cushman and I took the boat across the river. Jim Koeppen drove in later that afternoon. The day was clear, cold and dead calm. I didn’t feel like hunting and instead enjoyed the fresh air and sunshine on a long walk with Ivy. Later, I took her out in my boat to see whether anyone needed dog work. Chris and Owen, who were in blind \#15, didn’t but Erik, who was in blind \#13, asked us to search for a mallard that had disappeared into a nearby patch of tulles. Ivy scoured the area for about fifteen minutes without success.

For dinner we had barbecued wild duck (from Jim Koeppen’s hunt in Canada) mushroom risotto and mixed vegetables. A Ruffino Riserva Ducale Chianti, vintage 2002, went very well. The nighttime temperature was expected to drop below freezing so Ivy slept next to my bed.

It was still quite cold on Thursday morning; the sky was partly cloudy and a brisk wind was blowing out of the southwest. I went to blind \#4 and spent most of the morning gazing at an empty sky while getting colder by the minute. The only bright moment came when a teal landed in the pond next to my pintail decoys. Ivy made an easy 15 yard retrieve. I also wasted three rounds at ducks that were probably out of range.

The Trader Joe’s pork bratwurst that I’d purchased for the day’s lunch was well received. In the afternoon, Erik, Chris and Owen went out while Jim Koeppen drove home to attend to a family matter. I read and rested in my room and later took Ivy for a short walk.

Thursday’s dinner was superb. Using a recipe he’d acquired on a hunt in Argentina, Chris marinated Cornish game hens for several hours and then cooked them perfectly on the barbecue. They were accompanied with baked potatoes and peas. Our wine was a 2005 Kim Crawford Unoaked Chardonnay from New Zealand. Everyone liked it and I decided my cellar could use some additional bottles.

On Thursday night the temperature moderated enough for Ivy to sleep *al fresco*. Some light rain fell. On Friday morning the wind had shifted to the north and it was bone-chilling. The sky was overcast and there was a light ground fog which made the morning about as dismal as I can remember. I went back to \#4 pond and moved a few of my decoys in order to adjust to the changed wind direction. I needn’t have bothered; the sky remained empty. I did fire two shots at a solitary duck that came by at marginal range. I was happy when the time came to pick up my decoys and go in.

We made our own sandwiches from a spread of cold meats and cheeses and then settled down for the afternoon. We’d agreed not to go hunting so as not to disturb the ducks before the Saturday shoot. Later that afternoon, Owen accompanied us on a walk. We turned around when Owen observed a mallard on the pond next to Division Line Road.

The Saturday hunters arrived at 4:30. We had beef stew for dinner with lemon cake for dessert.

On Saturday morning I decided to return to blind \#4 simply for the view. The wind had shifted back to the southwest and I set my decoys accordingly. The most satisfying moment of the three days was when a teal flew past. I blew my teal call and it turned around, came back and crossed at 30 yards. One shot brought it down and Ivy was quickly out and back. I didn’t do as well when a second teal came by. I fired a hurried off-balance shot with the expected result.

At 9:00 o’clock, just as I was thinking about going in, I spied a pair of widgeon circling my decoys. My first shot missed but my second connected. The duck fell a few yards short of the tulle patch about 60 yards south of the blind but swam into the reeds before Ivy could reach it. She searched the area for 25 minutes but couldn’t find it.

We had hot corned beef sandwiches for lunch. The only notable success of the morning was at blind \#10, where Gary and Jared Cushman bagged four teal and a widgeon.

Because of the tide, we stayed at the club until three o’clock. On the drive home, I still felt the cold and after hunting on four successive days, Ivy was truly “dog tired.”

Three day bag: two teal for ten cartridges for a 5.00 cartridge-per-bird ratio. One duck lost.

**Wednesday, January 9, 2008: Slim Pickings**

On this hunt, five shooters bagged a total of one teal and two spoonies (plus four diving ducks taken by a guest).

We crossed the river at 4:00 o’clock under a leaden grey sky with light rain. Ivy and I took a short walk but saw no ducks.

The dinner was the best part of this hunt, barbecued tri-tip, sautéed asparagus, roasted potatoes and lemon cake. Paul Holland, Marc’s guest, brought a Barolo and I contributed a 2003 Bordeaux.

The rain had stopped when I went out to tuck Ivy down and I enjoyed a fine view of the surroundings. On Wednesday morning there was drizzle, low fog and a very light wind that kept shifting between the west and northwest. I went to blind \#4, had three opportunities and fired six shots in vain. To illustrate how desperately bad the hunting had become, I deliberately fired two shots at a spoonie.

After a warming bowl of Harlan’s home-made split pea soup, we had tri-tip sandwiches for lunch and went home at two o’clock.

**Saturday, January 12, 2008: A Titanic Adventure**

The title of this chapter was suggested by Chase Isrealson, whom I met through the Order of Malta. We became friends upon discovering our mutual fondness for duck hunting. Chase is a member of the Sacramento Outing, a premier club in the Butte Sink, said to be the oldest duck club west of the Mississippi. When Chase invited me to be his guest there, I leaped at the opportunity. Friday afternoon saw Ivy and me driving the 150 or so miles to the locale. The day was cool with a high fog.

The Sacramento Outing’s facilities are first-rate, indeed all that could be wished for. Members’ rooms are situated in a long low motel-like building with a bathroom for each two rooms and spacious bar and lounge at one end. Meals are taken in a separate building. I enjoyed a delightful steak dinner while Chase and his colleagues complained to me about how poor their season was, specifically, on some mornings shooters bagged “only” four or five mallards, instead of the usual seven. They did mention a couple of problems, the water was a foot or so above shooting level and the mallards were paired up, meaning that they weren’t particularly eager to decoy. Their final word was, “Bob you’ll have mallards all over you tomorrow” and during the night, visions of circling mallards danced in my head.

A light rain was falling at wake up time but it had stopped as we boated out to our blind under a partly cloudy sky, with the dramatic sight of the Sutter Buttes behind us. I brought two guns, my trusty Beretta 390 and, because a London Best gun is appropriately used in the best of places, my Holland & Holland 20 gauge over/under. Early in the morning there were more mallards in the air then I’ve seen in a long time, but they were skittish. When a ringneck duck raced by the blind at pond level, one shot from the Holland brought it down and Ivy made a neat retrieve.

Feeling that I needed something heavier to deal with the mallards, I unlimbered my Beretta, cased the Holland and put it down in the boat.

Shortly after 8:30, Chase hit a drake mallard that fell about 60 yards from our blind. Ivy didn’t see it fall. The water in the pond was too deep for wading, so Chase said he’d take Ivy out in the boat to retrieve the duck. Then we’d move to a more promising blind.

Things went rapidly downhill when Chase stepped down to the boat. It was hung up on a ledge in the blind and when Chase put his full weight down, it slipped free and capsized. Chase grabbed the blind and steadied himself, but my case with the Holland was floating on the surface and filling with water. I jumped into the water and grabbed it before it sank out of sight.

Fortunately Chase had a radio and the keeper and his assistant promptly came out and rescued us. Back at the club, clothes and gun were dried off. Chase called the morning a “Titanic experience.” Actually, the episode more closely recalls the fate of the French liner *Normandie,* which U.S. authorities seized in New York harbor when France capitulated in 1940. In 1942, while the *Normandie* was being converted to a troopship, there was a fire of suspicious origin. In fighting the fire so much water was pumped into the *Normandie* that it flooded and capsized. In any event, my story had a happier ending. Another member gave me two big mallards to take home and my gunsmith disassembled the Holland and after a thorough cleaning declared it rust-free.

**Wednesday, January 16, 2008: The Doggie Delinquents**

It was back to the old routine on Tuesday morning, when Marc, Chris, Mike Corsetti, Jim Graziani and I crossed the river shortly after 11:00 o’clock, the time dictated by the tide. We had sandwiches for lunch and then picked blinds for an afternoon hunt. I picked blind \#16 but when Ivy and I arrived there, I just didn’t feel like hunting. Maybe it was the look of the pond, there was no wind and the sky was empty. More likely, it was the Bloody Mary I’d had before lunch. In any event, I let Ivy run around for a while, then put my equipment back into the boat and returned to the club. I stretched out on my bed with a mystery novel, but soon fell asleep.

I woke an hour later feeling much better and greatly enjoyed our dinner of perfectly barbecued steak, baked potatoes, sautéed asparagus and ice cream with chocolate sauce.

Wednesday’s forecast called for very strong winds but the morning dawned calm, and perfectly clear. I invited Marc to join me in blind \#15. We saw a number a ducks in the air but had hardly any shooting opportunities. Shortly after sunrise, a spoonie came to the decoys. I fired and it came down about 50 yards west of the blind. Ivy went out and chased it around the pond as it repeatedly dove. It finally escaped into the reeds by the boat ditch. Marc had better luck; he solidly hit a teal that came down 40 yards behind the blind and was promptly retrieved by Ivy.

We picked up at 9:00 o’clock in order to depart while there was still enough water beneath our dock. Ivy usually runs around while I’m picking up but this time she stayed near the blind. I discovered the reason when I saw her chewing on the remains of Marc’s teal. He’d left it at the blind. My normal practice is to take my ducks with me when I go out for my boat. It will be a long time before I’ll be allowed to forget Ivy’s transgression.

About same time Lucca, who was with Jim Graziani and Mike Corsetti in \#12 pond, went on a frolic of her own. Ignoring Jim’s repeated calls, she ran around the pond and eventually meandered all the way to blind \#15, which by this time we had vacated. Jim had to drag his boat the quarter mile length of the pond and lift Lucca into it because she was too exhausted to get in by herself. Back at the club, Jim, himself exhausted and exasperated, announced, “She’s no longer a duck dog.”

Bag: skunked for one cartridge fired; one duck lost.

Cumulative bag: seven mallards, one pintail, one widgeon, four teal and one bluebill for fifty-nine cartridges, per-bird average: 4.14. Four ducks lost.

**Wednesday, January 23, 2008: Under Threatening Skies**

When I picked up Marc on Tuesday afternoon, he looked in the back of the X-5 and said, “There’s that duck-eating dog.” We drove to McAvoy under an overcast sky with intermittent showers. There temperature was in the low 40’s and felt even colder. We made a fairly rough crossing a 4:00 o’clock and when we arrived, Harlan said there were some ducks on the property. Ivy and I took a shorter than usual walk because of the cold but I didn’t see any quarry ducks.

We dined on breaded fillets of tilapia, rice, peas and carrots with strawberry cheesecake for dessert, after which I brought Ivy in and settled down for the night.

At 5:00 a.m. there was light rain with a cold and brisk wind out of the northeast. I had first choice and, hoping to make amends for Ivy’s misfeasance, invited Marc to join me in blind \#12. The sky was overcast with threatening clouds and the wind continued unabated; we could see rain falling in various places around the marsh but none fell on us. For the first time in many weeks, there were quite a few ducks in the air, but at this point in the season they had become extremely wary. I fired two ineffective shots at a mallard that Marc said was out of range, my excuse being that when you’ve spent hours looking at ducks at 500 plus yards, 70 yards seems very close. In any event, my morning was saved at 9:45 when a large drake gadwall came to my decoys and crossed at 30 yards. I hit it solidly and Ivy made a routine retrieve. At 10:30 we picked up and went in. Jim Koeppen said the gadwall was suitable for mounting and display when the clubroom is rebuilt.

Erik Cushman and his guest Dan enjoyed a spectacular morning at blind \#10, bagging a teal and two Canada geese. Tim Murphy and Jeff Theibaut did well at blind \#8, scoring three gadwall and two teal. Mike Corsetti bagged a teal at blind \#21 while Jim Graziani and his guest Bob Bancero got skunked at blind \#28.

We had big hamburgers and French fries for lunch and crossed back to McAvoy at 1:30.

Bag: one gadwall for three rounds, ratio 3.00

**Saturday, January 26, 2008: Season’s End**

Friday afternoon was bitter cold and rain was falling in bucketfuls. As I drove out of my garage I asked myself, “Do I really want to go?” This question recurred several times during a two-hour traffic snarled drive to McAvoy. We crossed to the club at 4:15. When we arrived, a directors’ meeting took the place of my customary walk with Ivy and just as well, because it was still raining.

My enjoyment quotient improved markedly at dinner time, which featured buffalo *osso bucco* and *risotto Milanese* with sautéed asparagus and chocolate cheesecake for dessert. After assuring myself that the overnight temperature would remain above freezing, I dressed Ivy in her neoprene jacked and tucked her down in her kennel.

By 5:00 a.m. the heavy rain had passed to the east leaving only a few scattered drops and a cloud cover at 5,000 feet. I decided to spend my last morning of the season in my favorite blind. When I arrived at blind \#4, a light wind was blowing from the northeast but it gradually shifted to the southeast. The rising sun painted the overhead clouds in a spectacular range of colors, as magnificent a scene as could be wished for. No surprise, the ducks were few and far between except, of course, for the diving ducks A little after 8:00, I brought down a teal with a single shot and Ivy made a businesslike retrieve. Teal came by on two other occasions but I didn’t distinguish them from the sea ducks in time to be able to shoot.

As I picked up my decoys for the final time, I was pleased that I’d persevered the previous afternoon: I’d enjoyed a splendid dinner, observed a glorious sunrise and, wonder of wonders, even bagged a duck. Two other hunters each bagged a single teal and the three of us tied for high Gun.

We had salad, linguini with pesto sauce and garlic bread for lunch

Cumulative bag: seven mallards, one pintail, one widgeon, five teal, one gadwall and one bluebill for sixty-three cartridges, per-bird average: 3.875. Four ducks lost. Due to its extraordinary circumstances, I’ve not counted the cartridges fired on my Butte Sink hunt.

May you all enjoy the off-season.
