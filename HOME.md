## The diary of a San Francisco duck hunter

Greetings Intrepid Digital Explorer,

If you’ve arrived at the home page of Bob Granucci’s Duck Hunting Memoirs, you are probably either:

1. A duck hunter
2. Curious about the sport / pastime
3. Doing research for your great American novel (or Substack piece)
4. A novice who hasn’t the faintest idea what the appeal is, but you’re here now so why not read a little.

Before you unmoor your brain-boat and motor out into Bob’s journal, you might welcome a brief introduction:

For twenty-five years—1990 to 2015—Bob Granucci* keenly observed his time in the Suisun Marsh* with the St Germain Duck Hunting Club. Woven into these memoirs are all kinds of life-affirming themes and moments, gorgeous meals in good company, and yes, some less-thrilling, no-duck days.

But back to those life-affirming themes, here’s a teaser of Bob G’s Journal gems:

• The unspoken bonds between man and nature
• The camaraderie of men
• The spirit of the hunt
• Reverence for good food and meals shared
• The stillness of the marsh
• Funky duck names + which are the tastiest and toughest to catch
• Unconditional love between a man and his dog
• Full moons and waking before sunrise
• The weather’s fickle (but often awe-inspiring) decisions
• Deep satisfied exhaustion
• How duck hunting strips life down to its essence

We hope you dig Bob’s Duck Hunting Journals as much as Bob enjoyed his experiences and writing about them—for future readers like you.
