**1994-95 Duck Season Journal**

A New Adventure

Introduction: Change of venue.

It was bound to happen eventually. In early July, Sprig Farm was sold to Bill Richardson of Las Vegas. He was planning to refurbish the entire place, clubhouse and ponds, and he asked Al White, Dean Brubaker and Tom Lucas to stay and oversee the project. The rest of us began looking for new places to hunt. Thanks to Frank Fiala and Jim Graziani, my search was a short and successful one.

Within the week, Jim and Frank invited me to look at St. Germain. My first visit started with a minor adventure. On a sunny summer morning we boarded Frank's boat and set out from McAvoy harbor. As soon as we reached open water, we encountered a strong west wind with waves breaking over the bow. With a newcomer's naivete, I asked, "Do we get to do this every time?" Frank, more concerned than amused, turned back to the dock and we drove in to the club by way of the Grizzly Island Road. It didn't take me long to decide that I'd found a new home.

I went back in mid-September with Daisy and took her for a long walk over the dry ponds. The design and condition of the blinds impressed me. On the Saturday before opening day, Muriel and I brought up Daisy's insulated kennel[^1], my new 15 hp. motor and other gear. Frank gave us a tour around the club and took us to up Sprig Farm to retrieve my boat and some other items I'd left there. Herb and Barbara Frost, Sprig Farm's new keepers, showed us their new quarters and the remodeled kitchen; they were working hard to get the clubhouse ready for opening day. Later that afternoon, Muriel and I tested my new motor. With its 4 hp. motor, my boat used to plod along like a DC-3. Now it soared like a Concorde.

October 22nd -- Opening day: Daisy's distinguished debut.

The distance between McAvoy Yacht Harbor and St. Germain's dock is nearly two and one-half airline miles; the passage across the Suisun Cut is not a direct route and takes about fifteen minutes at the Isobel Lyons' cruising speed. I caught the noon boat and crossed under balmy skies. After lunch in the clubhouse, I joined a work party with Frank, Jim Graziani and some other members and helped pull out some tulles which were blocking the entrance to \#8 and almost blocking the width of Noyce Slough about 300 yards short of the entrance to \#15. I welcomed this opportunity to acquaint myself with St. Germain's channels and ponds.

Later that afternoon, Daisy and I took an hour's walk along the west side (division) road out to a point opposite \#8 pond. The weather was fairly warm, but not nearly as hot as last year, and the mosquitoes were noticeably fewer and less aggressive. Daisy put up a rooster pheasant by the gate at the junction. We saw some ducks on the ponds and a few small flocks in the air.

Friday's dinner was excellent, rack of lamb preceded by a beautiful hos deuvres tray. After dinner, Daisy and I walked for half an hour on the road to Wheeler Island. The evening was brightly moonlit with only the slightest hint of a breeze.

Saturday morning dawned clear and windless. Al Bertucci kindly invited me to share \#8 pond. He went to \#8A, I to \#8B. After entering the pond, I had some difficulty finding the island. Once there, I was delighted with the blind's excellent concealment and comfortable space for Daisy. A few minutes after shooting time, I called in a drake sprig and brought it down with one shot. As Daisy was making a routine 40 yard retrieve I said to myself, "Piece of cake! I'll soon have a limit." Was I wrong! I missed shots at birds at marginal range. The final humiliation was having a teal land in my decoys and missing three shots at it when it flared. On a positive note, I recognized and held fire on the many spoonies which came to my decoys.

Fortunately, Daisy redeemed the morning with a first-class retrieve for Al. He'd crippled a sprig which swam to the border of the pond. I took Daisy over and she went into the grass and chased the bird out into the open water. It dove and swam back the grass but Daisy picked up the scent, hunted it down and brought it to my hand.

Overall, the morning was most enjoyable. I saw many more ducks in the air than last year but they didn't seem interested in working our pond. The weather was pleasantly brisk. Around 8:30 a light wind blew from the east. Interestingly, Jim Koeppen, who was in \#21, said the wind there was from the west. At 10:15 the action slowed and I picked up and went in.

bag: one sprig.

Other: Most of the other shooters did quite well. Frank limited on teal (the skeet shooter's bird). Jim Graziani and Mike Corsetti limited at \#15. Jim doubled on widgeon.

Wednesday, October 26th: Settling in.

Tuesday afternoon felt like fall, temperature in the high 60's, a fresh wind from the west and the sky decorated with a variety of high and middle clouds. Our crossing was choppy. Daisy and I walked a mile or so out the west road where we met Mike Mendez and his guest. Several small flocks of ducks were flying over our ponds. We took another walk after dinner; by now the air was fresh and there was a ring around the moon. I felt at home in my room and got a good night's rest.

On Wednesday, Frank took me to \#15. The morning was cool with some high clouds and a 10-15 mph wind out of the west-southwest. I missed three shots at a flock of ducks that decoyed in shortly after shooting time. Frank and I hit a bird which sailed about 300 yards down the pond and went into the grass. Daisy went out after it, I followed and we hunted it intensely but unsuccessfully. All morning the ducks passed over our blind just out of range, except for one mallard which Frank brought down with my 1100 which he had borrowed after the extractor broke on his 11-87. Daisy made a routine 25 yard retrieve.

Meanwhile, at blind \#12 in the upwind shore of the pond, Mike Corsetti and Mike St. Peter were having a great time, Corsetti was hitting everything he shot at while Mike St. Peter's young black labrador, Whiskey[^2], made her debut by retrieving eight ducks. Both Mikes couldn't have been happier with their morning. On Wednesday afternoon, we enjoyed a smooth crossing to Bay Point.

bag: skunked

Other: Shooting was mediocre for the rest of our hunters, 1-2 birds per blind.

Wednesday, November 2d: A taste of success.

Instead of shooting ducks on the weekend, I went to Pasadena, shot sporting clays on Friday and spent Saturday afternoon in the Rose Bowl, watching Stanford suffer a agonizing last-minute loss to UCLA. On Tuesday, the 4:00 o'clock boat made a rough crossing under a grey sky; a 15-20 mph wind was blowing out of the southwest while a weak cold front deposited 0.05 inches of rain in San Francisco. I took Daisy and Bandit for a walk on the west road but saw hardly any ducks.

Dean Brubaker came down for cocktails. He reported that the shooting at Sprig Farm was fairly good, particularly on the opening weekend. However, several of their new blinds had popped loose. Dean and Al White were the only shooters there the previous Wednesday. After an excellent filet mignon dinner, Chris Charles and I took Daisy for an evening walk on the road to Wheeler Island. The wind, still fresh, had shifted a few points to the west.

I got a surprise as I settled into bed. The frame collapsed. I put the box springs on the floor and slept fairly well.

Wednesday morning was clear, the wind still blowing from the west. I went to \#28 and was ready at shooting time, only to be greeted by an empty sky. The ducks started flying within a short time later, but they kept well out of range. However, the seagulls and hawks which circled close to the island told me the blind's concealment was excellent.

About 7:30 a teal landed the decoys. I flared it and brought it down with my third shot. It kept diving but Daisy persevered and finally caught it by putting her head under water. Around 8:45 a pair of gadwall came directly overhead. I brought down the drake with one shot, and missed a shot at the hen. The bird fell at the edge of the island, Daisy didn't even get wet making the retrieve.

It was a very quiet morning. I did see almost a hundred ducks get up from the east side of Sprig Farm; they made a circle and then settled down. The action ground to a halt at 9:30 so I picked up and went in.

bag: one gadwall and one teal

Other. Jim Graziani and his guest brought in a beautiful string of mallards.

Saturday, November 5th: First major storm.

Friday's crossing, made under a lowering gray and almost windless sky, was the smoothest yet; it was the proverbial lull before the storm.

Daisy and I stayed out over an hour walking along the division road. A few drops of rain fell and the wind started to freshen from the southwest, carrying the sounds of ducks on Rich Island's ponds; but we saw very few birds in the air or on our own ponds. After dinner we took a short walk on the Wheeler Island road. By this time, the wind was stronger and blowing from the south; the storm was coming in.

I slept well on the bed frame that John had borrowed from another club and awoke at 4:00 o'clock to the sound of a steady wind-driven rain. Frank suggested that I go to \#4; It was raining steadily and I took my time going up Noyce Slough so as not to miss the entrance. Once I found the channel, the way in to the blind was easy. As I set my decoys -- some near the shore behind the blind, the rest in a "V" extending out from the island -- I was impressed by the pond's layout, its island tucked in a corner much like \#8 at Sprig Farm. This blind is ideal for a south wind. There was only one problem, contrary to the forecast, the wind was blowing from the east. I didn't realize this at first because visibility was less than a mile and I was disoriented. In any event, I settled in, my back to the wind, and though my rain spotted glasses watched the many ducks which were flying during the first two hours. A teal came in range and I brought it down with one shot. Daisy made a routine 30-yard retrieve. I failed to recognize another teal until it was too late to shoot, but wasted two rounds at each of two large ducks which were almost certainly out of range. I passed up several spoonies which came by.

After 8:00 o'clock, the ducks started coming to my spread, flying upwind, wings cupped, going overhead just out of range, and then dropping into the windward ponds. By 9:45, Daisy and I decided to come in out of the cold and wet. Still, it was a productive morning. I'd learned that \#4 pond will shoot well in a south or west wind and, when Jim Koeppen told me that he'd seen ducks dropping into \#1 pond, I decided to try that blind in the next storm.

Saturday afternoon's crossing, with limited visibility, high waves and a zig-zag course, reminded me of the stories about convoy duty in the North Atlantic during World War II.

bag: one teal.

Other: Tony's lunch, corn chowder followed by hot roast beef sandwiches, was enthusiastically received by all hands.

Mike Corsetti brought in another beautiful string of big ducks. (This is news?) Other hunters did fairly well.

Intermission: Reflect, retrain, reequip.

The four-week layoff brought a succession of rainstorms which allayed our concerns about another dry winter. I exulted with the 49'ers, groaned at Stanford's gridiron misfortunes, meanwhile counting down the days until the second-half opener. I also reflected on my experience. Four ducks in as many outings is hardly brilliant, but I felt anything but discouraged. I'd enjoyed St. Germain's fine food and lodging, been impressed with its blinds and was feeling at home with my fellow shooters. They were getting ducks in good numbers; my day would surely come.

I devoted several sessions of skeet and sporting clays to emphasizing the fundamentals: eye locked on the target, smooth and positive gun mount, keep the gun moving, head on the stock, and follow though. My confidence began to return.

I bought new decoys (magnum sized mallards and teal, one dozen each, with swiveling heads no less), a Barbour jacket ("the best British clothing for the worst British weather"), practiced with Daisy to get her comfortable putting on her new neoprene jacket and finally, bought some heavier loads, 3 inch, ounce and 1/4 no. 1's (to surprise Mr. Mallard, complacently cruising by at 45 yards range).

Saturday December 3rd: Return to the Marsh.

This activity-packed outing began a day early. Tony's legal situation raised questions about his availability to cook. I volunteered to go a day earlier to help Jim Graziani in the kitchen. In any event, it wasn't necessary (Steve Lyon posted Tony's bond). A storm was forecast for the weekend and on Thursday afternoon I drove to Bay Point under a gray sky. The crossing was extremely smooth.

I especially enjoyed talking with Jim's guest, George Bignatti of Indianapolis fame. He shared many interesting tales from the golden age of American motor racing. I particularly enjoyed hearing about his collaboration with Graham Hill and Jackie Stewart.

On Thursday afternoon Daisy and I took an extremely long walk and saw more ducks than I'd seen in a long, long time. Literally, excitement was in the air.

Friday proved to be a delightful day on the Marsh. We went pheasant hunting in the morning. Bandit and Daisy got up one pheasant, which we missed. Bandit cut his foot in the thorn bushes. Jim gave him first-aid and kept him quiet for the rest of the day. In the afternoon Daisy and I boated up to Sprig Farm, had a pleasant chat with Herb Frost, then took a walk out the west side road. We didn't see many ducks on the state property or on Sprig Farm's west side ponds. Herb and his wife have three domestic cats and they appear to have the rodent population under control.

After returning to St. Germain, Daisy and I walked out the point to watch the 4:00 o'clock boat arrive.

Although fine meals at St. Germain are the norm, Friday's dinner was special, osso bucco complemented by an outstanding 1990 Sterling Cabernet.

I settled down on Friday tired from all the walking and enjoyed a good night's sleep, and I couldn't wait to get out on the ponds. The long-forecast rain arrived after dinner. Jim Koeppen said he heard the ducks flying off the marsh.

I picked blind \#1. I went past the entrance because the sign was hidden behind a block of tulles. Then I got lost on the way in. I reached the pond a little before shooting time. The pond is set up for a south wind but the wind was from the east, with a light rain. My Barbour jacket kept be bone dry throughout the morning. As I was hiding my boat, I saw ducks working my decoys. The sky was full of spoonies; I shot at one and missed. I also missed a shot at a flock on lesser scaup (bluebills) which raced along the surface of the pond. I hit a hen scaup with my third shot. A pair of mallard surprised me. They came directly overhead but I didn't see them in time to shoot. About 9:00 o'clock a teal flew by. I called it back and bought it down with one shot. (I'm beginning to see the leads again.) Daisy made two routine retrieves and seemed comfortable in her neoprene jacket. There were a fair number of ducks in the air but they were high.

By Saturday Bandit's foot had healed enough for him to go hunting. Jim and George got eight ducks, most of them teal. The front went through a little after noon; up till then there a light fog restricted visibility to a mile. There were still storm clouds but the air was clear and the scenery beautiful.

The trip back across the river was another adventure. The high tide brought the water almost to dock level and we had to lift Daisy into the Isobel Lyons. A strong south wind made it difficult to pull away from St. Germain and also to dock at McAvoy's.

bag. 1 teal and 1 bluebill

season 1 sprig, 1 gadwall, 1 bluebill, 3 teal

Wednesday, December 7th: Success at last.

I reached McAvoy at 3 o'clock and helped Jim shop at Safeway. Fortunately the boat waited for us and we pulled away from the dock at 4:15. Daisy and I took a short walk out to the gate, but saw only a few ducks. There was fresh wind from the west and a pretty sunset in a sky partly covered with high clouds.

A dinner of scampi, then early to bed. At 4:00 a.m. Tulle and Daisy were barking furiously at what sounded like an intruder. Later, Tony told me Daisy had growled at him when he walked out to the kennel at midnight.

Wednesday dawned bright and clear with a fresh wind out of the west. Jim, who had left Bandit home to recuperate, took us to \#8 pond. We got nine ducks between us. I shot a canvasback, a widgeon and 2 teal. I know I hit some ducks that kept on flying. Most of Daisy's retrieves were routine but she made one that was exceptional. Jim sailed a teal which went down in \#10 pond, at least 400 yards away. Daisy went out an made an unassisted retrieve.

I had success calling in teal and a made a few good shots. Low point of the morning was when I called in a flock of ten or so teal and missed three shots at them. I had a grand time shooting with Jim and reminiscing about our college days.

bag. 2 teal, 1 canvasback, 1 widgeon

Saturday December 10th: "Duck Weather"

Friday afternoon's walk with Daisy, made under partly cloudy skies, was shorter than usual; we had to get ready for the marsh party. About 90 guests from neighboring duck clubs heartily enjoyed St. Germain hospitality -- almost to the point of embarrassment. They consumed all of a 60 pound beef roast, the 600 ravioli Jim Graziani had made and they drank nearly all of our wine. I enjoyed sharing dinner with Dean and Al White and his brother-in-law, and chatting with Jim Jacobsen and Tom Lucas. Jim remarked, "This club is squared away."

The night was cold and fortunately, Bandit invited Daisy to share Jim's boat locker. The walkways had a coating ice at wake up time.

Mike Corsetti invited us to join him in \#23 blind. When we were settled in, he commented, "this feels like duck weather." He was referring to the 40 degree temperature, northeasterly wind and the light fog which reduced visibility to about three quarters of a mile. For the first two hours the action was terrific, more ducks in the sky and over the blind than I've seen in many years. Mike put on a calling and shooting exhibition that left me green with envy, hitting with nearly every shot. He seems to be a natural gun pointer. My shooting was mediocre, some good hits followed by humiliating misses.

Daisy, "working like a dog," had her most arduous morning ever. Mike and I shot nine ducks between us, many of which were cripples which came down a long way out in the vast pond. Several were divers. Daisy swam down and retrieved all of them, except for a mallard hen which dove and stayed down. Counting the total distance out and back, it is a conservative estimate that Daisy swam over a mile in the cold water of \#23 pond.

We saw a magnificent flight of swans over the blind.

bag 1 sprig, 1 bluebill and 3 teal

Wednesday, December 14th: One of those days.

Another storm was approaching the Bay Area Tuesday afternoon. Daisy and I took our afternoon walk, an especially scenic one, and I was fascinated to see the sprig and mallards dropping into \#1 pond.

George Couch, a friend and fellow rifle team member from my USF days, was Jim's guest. Tony was absent so George and Jim prepared dinner, excellent baked chicken according to George's recipe. George and Jim had cooked together for several years while members of Montezuma Ranch.

The forecast was for wind from the south preceding a rain storm. I went to \#1 and set my decoys for a south wind, Unfortunately the wind continued to blow from the east and the rain, barely a drizzle at shooting time, got heavier as the morning wore on. There were very few ducks over my blind, although all morning I saw many birds flying into the Rich Island ponds just across the road.

I stayed out a long time, hoping for a shot and about 10:30 finally brought down a duck. It swam toward the pickleweed on the east side pond, then dove as Daisy approached. We searched for 20 minutes but weren't able to find it.

I went in tired, wet and frustrated, but on reflection I concluded that the morning was worthwhile because I learned (or better yet, relearned) some lessons about decoy placement. I am still intrigued by \#1 pond and intend to return there when the wind is not blowing from the east.

bag: skunked.

Other: The crossing back to McAvoy was the roughest of the season.

Saturday, December 17th: Spoonie swarms and mechanical woes.

Friday afternoon was dreary; a damp fog on the river reduced visibility to a mile, while a bone-chilling wind blew out of the east. We saw few ducks on our walk but observed an owl atop a telephone pole on the Division Road. Daisy put up a pheasant near the gate.

Dinner featured a excellent New York strip roast. I enjoyed a good night's sleep and awoke to see the lights across the river. Rich Island was also clearly visible. the fog had lifted.

I went to \#4 pond and set my decoys for the wind as it was blowing (not as I thought or hoped it would), 2 lines of sprig in a "V" each starting about 20 yards downwind, a dozen teal around the island and my mallards upwind of the island in the calm water near the shore. The spoonies gave this spread rave reviews. I started badly, hitting a teal at 50 yards which dove on Daisy, and then, while out hunting the teal, shooting a spoonie which fell stone dead. The decoy spread brought many ducks in range, nearly all of them were spoonies. There were also many goldeneyes and ruddys in the pond, some even swam among my decoys. I missed some shots but did get two teal, which Daisy routinely retrieved. Around 9:30 what looked like a large duck came near the decoys. I fired two shots, the second seemed to frighten it. The bird flew several hundred yards and then dropped near the far shore of the pond, about two-thirds of the way to \#7. This was too far to send Daisy so I took the boat over. It turned out to be a spoonie hen. Much effort for so little return. I thought about going in but went back to the blind. About 10:30 I called in a teal, brought it down with one shot and so filled out my limit.

bag: 3 teal and 2 spoonies.

Other: I observed many big ducks in the air and watched a flight of at least 30 swans land across the road at Rich Island. However, shooting was sparse over the club and only a few prime ducks were taken. Tim Murphy took my spoonies to be made into sausage. Mike St. Peter's outboard motor stopped when he was half way to his blind and he had to row about a mile back to the dock. On Saturdy afteroon Chris Charles' car failed to start so Daisy and I gave him a ride home.

Wednesday, December 21st: Daisy's fau paux.

Tuesday afternoon was dreary and foggy, though not quite as bleak as the past Friday. Daisy, Bandit and I walked out on the Division Road until the light faded and saw a few ducks. Tim Murphy invited the group for cocktails in his suite and we all appreciated his hospitality. Tony missed the boat but caught Wheeler Island's 4:30 boat. Jim took the Isobel Lyons out and made a successful mid-river transfer.

Wednesday dawned cold and overcast, with 10-15 mph wind from the east. Tim Murphy invited me to shoot with him at \#7. We originally set the decoys downwind from the blind; after an hour we moved them and started to draw the ducks in. This is when Daisy disgraced herself. Tim shot a teal which Daisy routinely retrieved. Tim put it alongside the blind and reloaded his gun. Then, as we were scanning the sky for more ducks, Daisy quietly pushed her head underneath the cover, took the teal and began to eat it. By the time we became aware of what she was doing, she had skinned the bird and was about to eat the breast. Appropriate discipline was applied and Daisy, duly chastened, settled down behind the blind.

Fortunately, she soon redeemed herself. Tim shot another teal which sailed a good distance before going down in the pickleweed east of the blind. I took Daisy out about 150 yards along the line where the bird had gone in. Daisy stopped at a clump of pickleweed and went on point. I couldn't see anything but told her "Get the bird." She put her head underwater and brought up the teal (which I immediately grabbed before she could even think about chewing it).

Throughout the morning Tim kept connecting on a series of awesome, almost impossibly long shots. Result, a limit of 6 teal, 2 spoonies, a widgeon and a hen mallard. This made me wonder whether I've been too conservative in estimating range. Two unassisted long-distance retrieves restored Daisy to Tim's good graces. Yet as we were leaving the blind around 10:00 o'clock, he couldn't resist commenting, "With all the feathers around, this place looks like a plucking shed."

Saturday, December 24th: Close call.

A series of weak fronts weren't strong enough to push the fog off the marsh so on Friday, we again crossed under gray skies with two miles visibility. The river was at high tide and, as we pulled alongside the dock, I said to myself, "Getting off the boat is going no problem." Wrong! As I was stepping on to the dock, I tripped on the mooring line and started to fall into the water. Fortunately, several pairs of strong arms grabbed me and, except for some scrapes on the fingers of my left hand, I was safe and sound. Gary Cushman and Mike Corsetti gave me first aid.

Daisy and I took our usual walk, this time accompanied by Chris Charles and Tulle. Tulle's nine years didn't show as she outran Daisy. Dinner was especially festive, Caesar salad, roast beef and for desert, Muriel's plum pudding which I flamed with half a bottle of brandy. It was well received.

I heard rain on the room at 3:00 a.m. I'd been fighting a cold for the past few days so after breakfast, I went back to bed and slept another hour. By 7:00 the rain had stopped, so Daisy and I went out to \#4. I set thirty-six decoys and was ready to shoot at 8:30. There was no wind and very few ducks were flying, and yet the stillness on the marsh seemed appropriate for the day before Christmas. When a few ducks came by at extreme range I imitated Tim Murphy (with one slight difference, I missed them.) We went in around 10:15 and, after soup and sandwiches, made a noon crossing. By this time the fog was gone and the scenery was delightful.

Wednesday, December 28th: Daisy's opportunism.

Another crossing under a fog shrouded sky; this time the tide was so low we had to dock at Rich Island. Our gear and was trucked over to St. Germain while Mike Corsetti, Larry Godwyn, Jared Cushman, Daisy and I walked along the levee. We saw a skunk scurry to the side of the road and gingerly passed around it without incident. Daisy, Jared and I detoured out the Division Road and saw a beautiful pink sky at sunset and a number of ducks and geese in the air and on the surrounding ponds.

Dinner featured barbecued butterfly leg of lamb followed by chocolate mousse for desert. However, Jim Koeppen cast a pall on the evening when he said he'd heard ducks flying off the marsh in advance of the rain which was forecast for that evening.

The front passed through during the night and I awoke to a beautiful scene, a clear star filled sky with scattered high clouds, the waning moon rising over the river and a fresh wind blowing from the southwest.

Daisy and I went to blind \#9; the pond's narrow contour recalled memories of Sprig Farm's \#1 pond. Jim Koeppen's observation was confirmed; the morning was very, very slow. However, I didn't mind, the scenery was magnificent and I enjoyed watching the high flying ducks, plus the hawks and other bird life around the pond. Around 8:00 o'clock I shot a teal. It fluttered down at the east shore of the pond which borders an expanse of dry ground. We searched the area without success for twenty minutes or so. Later I took a long range shot at a sprig which came down in the pond. Daisy went out but at her approach, the bird got up, circled the pond and flew away. For reasons of her own, Daisy made a circuitous return by way of the tulles along the channel. I called her but she kept hunting. Then she disappeared into the tulles and came out with a freshly crippled hen sprig which I happily put on the strap.

A little before 10:00, a hen mallard worked the pond for about five minutes in response to my widgeon call. A couple of shots brought it down in the general area we'd searched for the teal. Daisy and I went over and she soon went on point. I looked at the pickleweed bush directly in front of her nose but saw nothing. I told her "Get the bird!" She burrowed under the bush and came out with a still lively teal. Daisy thought she was finished and started back toward the island but I told her there was more work to do. She resumed hunting and found the mallard few minutes later. I picked up and took a slow and very contended boat ride back to the clubhouse.

bag. 1 sprig, 1 mallard, 1 teal

Other: Shooting was sparse all over the club. Gary Cushman and his son Jared were top guns with a pair of sprig. Adam Lyons and his guest got one widgeon.

Saturday, December 31st: Auld Lange Syne.

Only a thin fog covered the river during the afternoon crossing and the pale sun's reflections on the calm water seemed like a Turner painting brought to life. Daisy, Bandit, Chris Charles and I took a short walk but other than a pheasant which Bandit put up, we saw nothing worth noting.

Frank and I were invited to Sprig Farm for cocktails. Bill Armstrong was there as Dean's guest. On arriving, I was delighted to see Fred Ellers. He and Dean were working on the R.O. system. The club room (in fact the whole building) was spic and span. For an hour or so, we sat around the old cocktail table with Bill, Dean, Fred, Tom Lucas and his son Tony, sharing drinks, smoked salmon and best of all, nostalgic memories of my duck hunting "alma mater." Fittingly enough, a toast was raised to our colleague Gregory Stout.

Frank's boat made the trip back to St. Germain in seven minutes. Jim Graziani supervised the dinner, cioppino made with a variety of absolutely fresh seafood and flavored with the most subtle and delicious sauce I've ever tasted. After giving Daisy and Bandit their after dinner walk and good night biscuits, I retired around 9:30.

By 5:00 a.m. the fog had lifted and I could even see the lights of Fairfield. It began to rain at breakfast time, so I waited a half hour until the rain stopped and then went out to blind \#4. We saw a pink sunrise but as we reached the pond, the rain returned for another half-hour. A cold wind blew out of the east all morning. The action was slow but after missing a few shots, I called in two flocks of teal, downing one bird with one shot each time. I was so happy about making good hits that I didn't even think trying for a double. Daisy's two short retrieves were unremarkable.

However, the morning was anything but routine for Al Martinelli and Les Vacari. They'd finished hunting and were running down Noyce Slough to the dock when they came up behind Jim Graziani and his guest George Bignatti. When Al started to pass, his boat rolled in Jim's wake, tossing both men into the water. Jim saw a horrified expression on George's face. He looked back to see Les struggling to keep his head above the water while Al was hanging on to his boat. Its motor was still running and it was making slow circles. Jim immediately put about, covered the 50 or so yards to Les, had him grab hold of his boat and towed him to the bank where there was footing. Then Jim went out to Al's boat; George managed to scramble aboard and shut off the motor. Then Jim towed Al to the shore. Jim took Les back to the dock while George brought Al back in his own boat.

Fortunately, Les and Al escaped serious injury. Their wet clothes soon dried while hot showers and coffee royals warmed their chilled bodies. But everyone went home chastened by the thought of what almost happened. This incident was a very graphic reminder that safety on the marsh is a full-time concern; it cannot not be taken for granted.

Bag: 2 teal

Wednesday, January 4th: Storm tossed.

Rain and strong southerly winds were forecast for the next 24 hours and high stratus clouds covered the marsh as we made a smooth crossing on Tuesday afternoon. Bandit came along on our walk out the Division Road. He gave us several anxious minutes by disappearing in the fading light when we were opposite \#4 pond. We saw only a few ducks. On the way back to the clubhouse, Daisy walked by some bushes where a skunk had recently sprayed and picked up a faint but noticeable aroma. In light of the mild evening, it seemed appropriate for her to sleep al fresco.

Some rain fell during the night and, when I went out at 5:00 o'clock to give Daisy her morning biscuit, a terrific wind was blowing out of the southeast. A hard rain fell while we were having breakfast, so I delayed my departure for half an hour. Jim Koeppen astutely suggested that I go to 26A. When I arrived there were whitecaps on the pond. I set half my decoys near and on the island and put the other half in the lee against the shore. The wind was blowing hard as I settled into the blind and started bailing it out. I looked up and saw a sprig struggling by, about 20 yards to my left. There were a few ducks in the air fighting the wind, and some of them came by the island just barely out of range.

Around 8:30 I shot a hen mallard which came down in the pond about 70 yards north of the island. The waves were so high that Daisy couldn't see it. She veered to the left and swam far out into the pond toward the main \#26 blind. I got out and walked to the point I saw the bird enter the pickleweed. We hunted it for 15 minutes. By then I was ready to give up. I didn't want to wade in the deep pond with the wind so strong, so I started back along the shore line parallel to Mud Slough road. Daisy refused to follow me and went in the opposite direction. I looked back and saw her 100 yards back, making tight circles by a bush opposite the gate on the road. I went over and watched her chasing the mallard, which was trying to hide in very shallow water. She finally caught it and we returned to the blind. Another pair of mallards came over the island but I didn't shoot because it was impossible for me to distinguish the drake from the hen against the gray sky. A short time later, I shot what I thought was a teal but turned out to be a bluebill. It was a diver but no match for Daisy.

Meanwhile the wind increased in force while in the south, an ominous wall of dark gray clouds advanced from Mt. Diablo. For my first time ever on the marsh, I felt the beginnings of fear. I decided to go in. Picking up the decoys was a struggle but the trip back to the dock was surprisingly easy; I hugged the lee bank of Noyce Slough and ran under reduced power.

When I reached to clubhouse, Rich Vacari told me he had some ducks down at \#13 pond and was going back there to pick up his decoys. By this time, the wind had died down so I volunteered Daisy's services and we went with him. We spent nearly forty-five minutes searching, but only found one spoonie. Still, this was commendable work on Daisy's part; the strong winds made scenting extremely difficult. All in all, the morning had proved to be exciting but very tiring.

Shooting all over the club was only fair. Frank initially decided we shouldn't attempt a crossing after lunch but he changed his mind when the wind eased off. In fact, the trip back turned out to be only slightly rough no problem at all for the Isobel Lyons.

Wednesday, January 11th: It might as well be spring.

A parade of Hawaiian rain storms had been drenching Northern California for six days -- the heaviest rains since 1986. Because of the weather and a cold, I stayed home on Friday the 6th. Actually, there was a break in the weather on Saturday morning. Although most of the ducks had departed the marsh in advance of the rain, our shooters enjoyed a pleasant morning and bagged few birds. In fact, Jim Graziani discovered a new way to call ducks. He was sitting in his blind enjoying the view, and the sight of a double rainbow inspired him to start singing "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" to Bandit. Then looked up, saw three mallards 20 yards overhead and bagged one of them.

It was pouring when I left the city on Tuesday afternoon but when I reached Bay Point the squall had passed and the sun shone on our crossing. We stopped at Rich Island to let off Clarence, their chief, and with some deft boat handling by Frank, we managed to pull away a huge log that had been blocking the entrance to Rich Island's harbor.

Daisy and I took a long walk under a partly cloudy sky. She put up two pheasants but, except for a few mallard pairs, there were no ducks to be seen. Cocktails in the Murphy-Lyons suite preceded a diner of Cornish game hens. Daisy, by now aroma free, bedded down in Bandit's boat locker.

The break in the weather continued into Wednesday morning. The day was mild and there was a brisk wind out of the southeast. The sky was partly cloudy but more rain was forecast for the afternoon. I went back to 26A. The action was extremely slow. I fired two shots and brought down two ducks, a goldeneye and a teal. Daisy had to chase the goldeneye in the shallow water behind the blind for about five minutes before she caught it. The teal came down dead and was routinely retrieved. The morning was very pleasant, more like March than January. There were some large flocks of sprig high in the air and various forms of bird life to be observed around the pond. As I went in, I managed to recover the three decoys that I'd lost the previous Wednesday; they had blown to the opposite shore. Some of our shooters did quite well. For example, Rich Vacari brought in one of the largest mallards I've ever seen; it was almost the size of a goose. Frank and Mike Mendez brought in four nice ducks. I also saw an unusual sight, a "V" of at least 30 cormorants taking off from \#28 pond. All in all, on this morning, the main satisfaction came from simply being out on the marsh.

Saturday, January 14th: Flood watch.

The heavy rains kept falling and local flooding occurred throughout Northern California. The Sacramento River continued to rise. As we arrived on Friday afternoon, our dock was awash. At high tide, the swollen river came within a foot of our levee. And more rain was predicted that night.

Most of us walked over to Wheeler Island and were apprehensive when we saw water percolating through the levee about 200 yards east of Wheeler's clubhouse. Wheeler Island's members didn't seem too concerned; they were sitting by their fireplace drinking cocktails. On the way back to our club, I thought I'd lost Bandit, but he had gone home before us.

Friday's dinner was memorable. I've never eaten better prime rib roast. However, the atmosphere wasn't entirely festive; if the levee breached, we'd have to evacuate the club and run to the boat. In light of this, Frank suspended Rule 3 and Daisy slept in my room.

Fortunately, during the night the rain eased and the levee held. Saturday morning dawned partly cloudy with a wind from the southwest. I went to Blind 28. A few minutes after shooting time, I hit a big duck, probably a sprig. It set its wings and sideslipped into the shallow water at the edge of the pond about 150 yards west of the island. We spent around 20 minutes hunting it without success. The morning was slow. Only a few good ducks were flying, but plenty of scaup and goldeneye came over my blind. I mistook a scaup for a teal and brought it down with one shot. During the morning I saw a marsh hawk showing great interest in a particular spot in the tulles which border the canal. Around 9:00 o'clock, I shot a drake spoonie (for the duck sausage) then picked up and took Daisy over to where the hawk had been working. We hunted the whole area for more then half an hour. Daisy put up two pheasants, but we never found the duck.

Saturday afternoon's crossing punctuated the end of the season in a bizarre -- but for this year -- fitting way. As we passed Wheeler Island in the Isobel Lyons, we observed hundreds of buffleheads, scaup and goldeneyes rafted together on the river. Then all at once they flew up, creating a literal cloud of sea ducks in the sky.

Reflections on the season:

Except for my mediocre shooting, this duck season turned out a most satisfying one. I'd been welcomed into a club full of friendly members, rich in tradition with a strong pride in doing things well. Daisy (except for the one earlier-recorded lapse) had performed well throughout the season, and brilliantly on several days. Of course I'll always have fond memories of Sprig Farm, but the move to St. Germain turned out very well indeed.

Season total: 3 sprig, 2 mallard, 1 gadwall, 1 widgeon, 1 canvasback, 4 bluebills, 15 teal, 3 spoonies, 1 goldeneye = 31 (74.2% prime ducks)
