**Introduction, return to the Marsh**

Medical problems had kept me from hunting for two seasons although on one occasion in January 2014 son John and I went to the Club for dinner and an overnight stay. The fellows gave me a hearty welcome that made me even more eager to return.

Thanks to physical therapy, my hopes of getting back to hunting, at least on a reduced scale, grew more realistic. I accepted that going out on my own, as I'd previously liked to do, would be foolhardy. However, during my time away from the club Siena had calmed down and I felt she would be welcomed by whoever wanted to take me with them.

On Thursday, October 17, two days early, Steve Martinelli, Chris Charles, Mike Corsetti and I went to the club. The crossing was set for 11:45 and I almost missed the boat because I mistakenly kept on \#80 when I should have taken \#580. I reached McAvoy Harbor barely in time. The crossing was pleasant; the sky was clear with a few mid-level clouds with a southwest wind. We had hot dogs for lunch.

After sitting idle for two years my boat was filthy. Steve kindly power washed it and also mounted my motor. I'd forgotten how to start the motor but when I recalled the technique it kicked over and I brought the boat over to my dock. To my delight, getting in and out of the boat was not difficult. Later, I took a walk with Siena out to the division line road junction and observed seven mallards on the nearby loafing pond. Siena had a grand time, jumping in and out of the water and then rolling in the dust. She had set out on our walk as a yellow lab and returned a chocolate one.

Abe Soto, our veteran chef, was back in the kitchen; he served an enjoyable dinner, barbecued chicken breast, asparagus and mashed potatoes with gravy. Mike Corsetti’s wine selections for the season were very much to my taste: Coppola chardonnay, Chalone pinot noir, and a surprisingly good Gen 5 cabernet from Lodi. After dinner I watched the Giants, then settled into bed happy for their victory and happier yet that I’d been physically able to get into and out of my boat, something I’d taken for granted in earlier years.

We slept late on Friday morning and arose after 7:00. Chris said that Siena howled at 3:00 and afterward he’d been kept awake by the sound of rats running between the walls.

Friday’s temperature was in the mid 70’s under a sky decorated with mid level clouds and a light north wind. I spent the morning loading the decoys and other paraphernalia into my boat and took it for a short run. The idle control wasn't quite right but the trouble didn’t appear to be all that serious. A group of hunters arrived around 3:00; Siena, her tail wagging, ran down to the dock to greet them. They commented on her good looks and friendliness.

There were twenty or so at the dinner table and the atmosphere was as festive as any in memory. And the meal as excellent: Caesar salad, New York strip roast slow cooked in the smoker, sauteed onions and mushrooms, asparagus, mashed potatoes with Abe’s excellent gravy and for dessert, chocolate flan topped with pears poached in red wine. At 8:30 I went out to give Siena her good night cookie. The air was warm and still, there was no moon and the mosquitoes were out in full force. In other words, it was a dark and swarmy night.

At 5:00 a.m. on Saturday, the sky was absolutely clear and the temperature warm without the slightest breath of wind. Mike Corsetti invited me to join him and selected Blind \#4, my favorite blind and the place where Ivy's ashes are buried. A new blind had been installed in the pond and we thought it would be close by. However, Mike couldn’t find it and he hunted out of my boat in the nearby tulles. It made little difference for during the morning there were very few ducks in the air and none came within shooting range. A beautiful white swan flew over me almost close enough to touch.

The lack of ducks didn't upset me; just being hunting out on the marsh felt like a triumph. I spent the morning sitting in my favorite blind enjoying the scenery and saying a prayer of thanksgiving for the many happy days I’d spent there in the past.

Siena was initially fussy but I when spread out my flotation coat next to the barrel, she settled down and stayed still all morning.

At 9:45 we decided to go in. Mike gave me a hand getting out of the barrel. It didn't matter that I hadn’t fired a shot. I said this was a hunt Jack Benny would have loved because of the money he saved on cartridges. Steve Martinelli took those of us who were going home across the river and I was at the house a little after three. I was very tired and decided that hunting once a week would be enough.

The Club’s total take on Opening Day was forty-four good ducks, i.e., mallards, pintail, wigeon and teal, mostly teal. Blaine Hudson generously gave me three teal to take home.

**Wednesday, October 23: The Skunk Pitches a Shutout**

Tuesday’s weather was delightful, with cirrus clouds decorating the bright blue sky, a fresh wind out of the southwest and excellent horizontal visibility. Frank Fiala, Mike Corsetti, Jim Koeppen, Sr., Mark Pasquini and I crossed to the Club at 2:30. Harlan reported that there were very few ducks on our ponds.

I walked Siena about two-thirds of the way out to the Division Line road but saw no ducks and very little other wildlife. A test of my motor revealed that the idle control wasn’t working, the motor would either run too fast or not at all. Harlan and Frank looked at it but neither could find the cause. We watched the World Series in the clubroom and the sat down to a dinner of spinach salad and chicken cacciatore, concluding with Abe’s tiramisu for dessert.

The scattered high clouds, a fresh cool southwest wind and clear visibility made Wednesday morning as beautiful as any I’ve ever spent on the Marsh. Only one thing was lacking; you guessed it, ducks. Mark and I borrowed Mike’s boat and went to \#10 while he and Frank went to \#12. The morning’s sole excitement was provided by a flight of five wigeon that flew over us at 45 yards. They came out of the sun and were away before we could react. Some other ducks circled over us well out of range.

We went in shortly after 10:00. We had heard shooting from the area of blind \#12 but Frank and Mike also came in empty handed.

Lunch featured grilled mild Italian sausages, with sautéed onions and sweet peppers. We crossed the river at 1:00 o’clock. Mark loaded my motor into his Subaru and took us to the San Francisco Boat Works where I’d spent \$500.00 having it serviced just before the season.

**Wednesday, October 29, 2014: The Club's New Theme Song**

Marc and I crossed the river at 4:00 o’clock on Tuesday afternoon, the temperature mild, a fresh breeze from the southwest, the sky clear with scattered mid level clouds, in short, a delightful autumn afternoon. Jim Koeppen, Frank, and Richard Vaccari filled out the party.

I asked Harlan whether there were any ducks on the property; he replied, “Bob, you don’t want to know.” I gave Siena a short walk, saw no ducks and then joined the others in the club room to watch the sixth game of the World Series, which the Giants lost.

Things looked up after that, for Jim Koeppen had brought some mallards from his hunt in Canada. Frank barbequed them and Abe served them with a wild rice mix and orange sauce. They were delicious. Dessert was Abe’s bread pudding with bourbon sauce.

To borrow from Raymond Chandler, on Wednesday morning a stillness covered the marsh like a sheet in the morgue. Marc and I slept in. After breakfast we took Siena for a walk out to the division line gate. She ran free and jumped in and out of the river and appeared to enjoy the time more than she would have had keeping still in a blind.

Richard Vaccari bagged a sponnie, and that was it. A song ran around in my mind, George Gershwin's “I've Got Plenty of Nothing,” from “Porgy and Bess.” The Club's new theme song?

We had hot dogs for lunch and then stayed at the club until 3:00 because of the low tide.

**Wednesday, November 5, 2014: Wonders Never Cease**

Marc and I weren’t expecting much on our drive to McAvoy for a 2:00 o’clock crossing. The afternoon was clear, with light haze and a soft wind from the west. At the harbor we met the usual suspects, Mike Corsetti, Frank Fiala, Jim Koeppen and Richard Vaccari.[^1] Harlan reported that there were “a few” ducks on the property.

[^1]: For readers of tender years, the phrase “the usual suspects” is taken from Claude Raines' celebrated line in the final scene of *Casablanca,* “Colonel Stroesser's been shot! Round up the usual suspects.”

I’d intended to walk Siena out to Division Line Road but turned around when I spotted a dozen or so ducks in and around the resting ponds next to blind \#1. Dinner was leftover strip steak with rice Pilaf, preceded by shrimp salad and concluding with Abe’s homemade apple pie and ice cream.

I awoke several times during the night and was increasingly heartened by the election returns. At 4:00 a.m., when I went out to give Siena her wake-up cookie, the sky was absolutely clear, with the full moon setting in the west and only a breath of wind from the east, hardly promising conditions.

I had first pick and invited Mike Corsetti to join me at blind \#12. We went out in his boat because my motor was still with the mechanic. I took the inner island and Siena immediately settled down when I spread my flotation coat next to the barrel. Shortly after dawn a spoonie passed within range. I fired a shot, missed but and was not really displeased. Half an hour later, a pair of gadwall passed overhead at 25 yards. I focused on the first one, pressed the trigger and was delighted to see it tumble into the pond about 15 yards away. I released Siena, she hesitated at the edge on the island but after repeated coaxing, she took a few steps into the water and then enthusiastically went out, picked up the bird and brought it to hand. This was my first duck in over two years and I couldn’t have been more pleased.

Later, Mike shot two spoonies. The first fell 80 yards from his blind. He called Siena and she went over to him. He got out of the blind, walked a distance toward the bird and when Siena finally saw it, she picked it up and brought it to me. His second bird fell closer to him. He simply pointed at the duck and she went to it.

I also fired at shot at a pair of mallards and missed either because I was off balance or the ducks were too high, or both. The one disappointment of this hunt was that Siena hadn't marked where the birds fell as well as Daisy and Ivy. Both dogs had marked and successfully retrieverd ducks that came down more than two hundred yards from from the blind. However, I was confident that with experience Siena would improve.

Marc and Frank enjoyed success at blind \#10. Each downed a sprig and a teal. These were Marc’s first ducks of the season and needless to say, he was overjoyed. Rich Vacccari usually brings in ducks when others fail, but this time he didn’t fire a shot.

We had spaghetti with meat sauce for lunch and departed the club shortly after 1:00 o’clock.

Bag: one gadwall for three rounds fired, ratio 3:00 per bird.

**Wednesday, November 12, 2014: Another Jack Benny Hunt**

On Tuesday afternoon, only four of us, Frank, Jim Koeppen Marc and I, met at McAvoy and crossed to the club at 4:00 o’clock. Harlan said there were just a few ducks on the property.

I took Siena for a walk but turned around at the bend in the road because I spotted about twenty-five mallard and gadwall on the resting pond by the division line gate. The temperature was cool with a light wind from the west. The sky was partially covered with a variety of mid-level clouds making for a pretty sunset.

Because of our small number, Abe’s services were dispensed with and Harlan prepared the dinner: green salad, corned beef and cabbage and apple pie a la mode for dessert.

Overnight the wind had shifted a few points to the southwest. Marc and I were the only ones who went out. My motor was back from the repair shop and it ran perfectly. On our way out to blind \#10, where Marc had enjoyed success the previous week, we saw about 100 ducks fly off. However, once we were in the blind, nothing came within range. The problem was that we were the only hunters on our club’s 850 acres and any ducks in flight simply settled down in the vacant areas. We did enjoy the skyscape, decorated with a variety of clouds in advance of rain that was forecast for the evening. Siena fussed during the morning and I decided to use the training collar the next time we went out.

We went in about 9:30 with all our cartridges. Harlan served corned beef sandwiches for lunch. The tide kept us at the club until shortly before 2:00.

**Saturday, November 22, 2014: Wet, Skunked and Happy**

Wednesday’s shoot was canceled for lack of interest. On Friday we crossed the river at 4:00 o’clock, the usual time. An overcast of mid level clouds and southwest wind lent credence to the forecast of rain that night and Saturday morning. We had almost a full house, not because of the hunting but the Marsh Party being hosted by the Wheeler Island Club. Harlan transported the lot of us in our club’s barely running 1987 Dodge pickup.

There were 50-60 guests and Wheeler’s hospitality was up to their usual high standards starting with hors devourers including fresh shrimp, a selection of Italian cold meats and cheeses, quiche and egg rolls. During the cocktail hour I had a pleasant conversation with Bud Blankenship, currently the keeper at Rich Island a long time friend of our club. Dinner consisted of barbequed tri tip, pork and chicken with Caesar salad, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach, concluding with a variety of cakes and pies. The wine, a 2011 Louis Martini Sonoma Cabernet, was admirable.

Saturday morning was something of an afterthought. Light rain had fallen during the night and at 4:45, when I went out to give Siena her good morning biscuit, the temperature was mild, with an overcast of rain clouds at 2,000 or so feet and a moderate wind from the east.

Shortly after 6:00, as Marc and I set out for blind \#10, a light rain began falling. Visibility remained good and we saw a number of ducks at a distance, but our shooting opportunities were minimal. A flock of teal blindsided us and sped away. Around 8:30 a mallard came by at 35 yards but Marc’s three shots failed to connect.

Even with her training collar, Sienna was fussy. She refused to settle on the flotation coat, probably because it was wet from the rain. Worse yet, she scraped away some of the vegetation next to my barrel.

We packed up around 9:30 and went in. As I was carrying my gun and kit back to the house, I felt that I had actually enjoyed all of the morning’s experience, even including my wet eyeglasses. Then I recalled the words of Blair Hoffman, a colleague in the Attorney General's Office, “ Duck hunters aren't really happy unless they're miserable.”

The front passed through later in the morning, leaving in its wake a brilliant blue sky decorated with cumulus clouds. We had spaghetti with meat sauce for lunch.

**Saturday, December 6, 2014: My Lazy Morning**

Rainy weather combined with the members’ lack of interest prompted Frank to cancel the Tuesday-Wednesday outing so I opted for the weekend hunt. The sky was covered with middle and upper level clouds and the temperature was mild with a moderate wind from the southwest. Rain was forecast for the night and early morning.

We departed McAvoy a little before 2:30 and when we arrived, Harlan reported that there were a few more ducks on our marsh. I walked Siena about two-thirds of the way out to the gate but observed only a solitary mallard and a pair of spoonies flying over the river.

Dinner had a Hellenic theme: Greek salad followed by roast leg of lamb, string beans and roast potatoes generously seasoned with garlic and rosemary. For dessert Abe served chocolate flan with pears baked in wine.

Rain was falling at 5:10, the wake-up time. I decided not to go out and after breakfast I went back to my room and slept until 8:20. By that time the rain had ceased, the weather was pleasant so I took Siena for a walk. She enjoyed herself running madly about and jumping into the river.

I spent much of the morning sitting out on the deck with Jim Koeppen Sr. sharing memories of Bay Area sports. The seven hunters who went out came in a total of nine good ducks.

We had pastrami and melted cheese sandwiches for lunch. I didn’t go home empty handed. Kurt and Jim Koeppen Jr. gave me two teal and Abe gave me a large platter of leftover lamb and potatoes.

**Tuesday - Wednesday, December 16-17, 2014: An Honorable Try**

Steve, Rich Vaccari, Marc and I crossed the river at 12:30, much earlier than usual because of the tide. The sky was lowering, the temperature mild and a moderate wind was blowing from the southwest. Rain was forecast for the evening and overnight. We thought we could beat the rain and decided to go out hunting in the afternoon. As it happened, the rain beat us. Marc and I went to blind \#12. Except for the occasional cormorant, hardly anything was flying. Around 4:00 I saw something slowly flapping its wings headed directly toward me. I assumed it was simply another cormorant but to my chagrin it turned out to be a drake mallard, directly overhead at 25 yards. Just before quitting time I missed a shot at a pair of ducks that could have been anything.

It started raining. What began as a drizzle grew heavier with the result that we came in drenched. I don't mind getting personally wet, but drying out my equipment, particularly my gun, was a bother. Anyway, Marc and I agreed that we'd made an honorable try.

We didn't need Abe because of our small number so Harlan prepared our dinner: Cornish game hens, rice pilaf, broccoli, mashed potatoes and apple pie for dessert.

Because of the weather I stayed in on Wednesday.

**Saturday, December 20, 2014: Dreariness**

Friday afternoon was fairly cold and foggy with no more than one mile of visibility. We crossed the river at 3:00 o'clock. When I asked Harlan whether there were any ducks, he replied, “Bob, you don’t want to know.” On a fairly short walk with Siena I saw no ducks and the scenery that usually adds to the pleasure of the outing was obscured by curtains of gray.

Dinner was the highlight of this outing: shrimp cocktail, roast New York strip, roast potatoes, grilled asparagus, and bread pudding with bourbon sauce.

I got up at 5:15 but it was still foggy so I went back to bed. At dawn the fog became even more dense and horizontal visibility narrowed to less than 200 yards.

When it became lighter I took Siena for walks at 9:30 and 11:00 but heard very little firing. Eleven hunters went out and they brought in a total of two teal and one widgeon.

We had lasagna for lunch and departed the club shortly before 2:00.

**Saturday, January 3, 2015: The Ducks Arrive (sort of)  
**

We crossed the river at 3:00 o'clock on Friday afternoon; the air was crystal clear but it was very cold. There were a few more ducks on the property

Our dinner menu was kale salad, New York strip roast cooked in the smoker, mushrooms, broccoli, with apple pie for dessert.

Fortunately, I dressed Siena in her neoprene jacket at bedtime because the overnight temperature dropped into the low 'thirties. The morning was so cold that I stayed in. Those who went out had mixed results.

We had pastrami sandwiches for lunch

**Wednesday**, **January 7, 2015: We Three**

Ar 4:00 o'clock on Tuesday Frank, Richard Vaccari and I crossed the river to the club. A dense haze restricted visibility while a cold wind was blowing out of the east. Harlan baked the king salmon that I'd caught in Alaska and served it with asparagus and mixed white and wild rice. The 2009 Beaujolais Villages that I contributed went very well. We had berry pie for dessert.

On Wednesday morning the light fog combined with the meager prospects once again made a sleep-in the better option.

**Tuesday-Wednesday, January 13-14, 2015: My Mistake**

Due to an unusual tide Frank, Marc, Richard and I crossed the river at 11 o'clock and had a lunch of tuna sandwiches at the club. Aware that there might be fog in the morning, we decided to go out in the afternoon. Marc and I went to blind \#10. A light wind was coming from the east; the sky was partly cloudy with fairly good horizontal visibility.

In the preceding two or three days an astonishing number of ducks had arrived at the club and when we entered the \#10 pond we saw more than 100 get up.

During the afternoon a number of birds circled our blind but shied off. It was entirely my fault. On the crossing Siena had been wearing her special collar and she was so beautifully behaved and so calm that I thought she wouldn't need it in the afternoon. This was a serious misjudgment. At the blind she fussed all afternoon and undoubtedly caused any number of flights veer off well out of range. At least we enjoyed seeing all the ducks.

Because of the small number we didn't need Abe and Harlan prepared our dinner: green salad, corned beef, cabbage, etc with apple pie for dessert.

The morning turned out to be as foggy as feared. I stayed in but Marc went out and had a moment of excitement when a large shape with slowly flapping wings materialized out of the gloom. Marc thought it was a goose, mounted his gun and then saw to his disappointment that it was a cormorant.

**Wednesday, January 21, 2015: Fogged In**

We crossed to the club shortly before 4:00 o'clock under a clear but hazy sky with a light wind from the east. Harlan announced, “They're here!” I took Siena for a half-hour walk during which I observed ducks on the ponds by the road and a few in the air.

We were joined by Blaine Hutson, Tad Bowers and several other season shooters who contributed to a spectacular dinner; it started with smoked mallard and venison in the club room followed at the dining table by cracked crab, abalone cakes and grilled asparagus with ice cream for desert. In my opinion, this was our best dinner of the season. Harlan found an excellent 2013 Pinot Grigio at Costco, a perfect accompaniment for the meal.

I had a fairly high blind pick and over cocktails Marc and I discussed several possible blind choices. Unfortunately it was not to be. After midnight a dense fog settled on the marsh. In the morning we both felt it would be safer to stay in until sunrise. At that time the fog was so dense that the outline of the Malfatanos' clubhouse, only 100 feet distant, could barely be made out.

My years on the marsh have given me a total dislike of being out in dense fog; it feels like sitting in a milk bottle. After enduring so many such mornings I had no desire to spend another one. Accordingly, I stayed in. This fog was even denser at 9:00 o'clock, when I took Siena for a walk; horizontal visibility was barely 100 yards.

The fog didn't begin to lift until shortly before noon. Tad, Blaine and their friends, experienced hunters all, were the only ones who did well. We had Reuben sandwiches for lunch.

**Final Thoughts**

Obviously, I was disappointed that my total take for the season was a solitary gadwall and more disappointed that Siena hadn't had been able to get needed experience retrieving ducks. On the other hand, just being at the club, and going out on the mornings when I felt up to it, was much to be thankful for. The setting, the fellows and the amenities, especially the food, were as enjoyable as ever. And there's always hope that we will see more ducks this fall.

My special thanks go to Mike Corsetti and Marc Pasquini for taking me out with them and to all, my best wishes for the off-season.
