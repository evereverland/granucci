**1995-96 Duck Season Journal**

(or, St. Germain Sophomore)

by Bob Granucci

Saturday, October 22nd:Opening Day -- Great Expectations.

As summer gradually faded into fall, my anticipation kept building as events confirmed the reports of a great increase in the duck population. The limit was raised to six. A senior Fish and Game official predicted a "once-in-a-century" opening day. Finally, on a mid-September drive to St. Germain, I saw hundreds of mallards in places they'd never been before. For example, the pond across the road from Balboa Farms was crowded with birds. And so on Thursday evening, while I was packing my overnight bag, when Muriel asked whether Daisy had been exercised enough to be in hunting shape, it's understandable that I replied, "Don't worry, the mallards are going to fall right into her lap."

A thin autumn fog shrouded the City at 11:30 on Friday morning as Daisy and I set off on the grand adventure, the Jeep loaded with motor, bedding, dog food, cartridges and all the other gear I'd usually have brought up before the season. An hour later we reached the McAvoy dock in ample time for the 1:00 o'clock boat. The sky was clear with a few cirrus clouds, the temperature 70 degrees; a fresh wind out of the west made the crossing a little rougher than expected, but pleasant nonetheless.

The many details involved in preparing my room and the boat occupied most of the afternoon but shortly before 5:00, Daisy and I, accompanied by Bandit and Jim Graziani, set out on a pre-dinner walk to the Division Road gate. Thanks to the wind, the mosquitoes were no bother. At first the sky was empty, but as we ambled along we began to see mallards in twos and threes, then in larger numbers.

Our Opening Day Eve dinner featured a delicious prime rib roast and a typically festive atmosphere. Afterward, I took Daisy for another short walk with Mike St. Peter and Whiskey, then settled down for the night. I didn't sleep very well. Ideas about blind selection and appropriate leads, mixed with images of ducks, kept running though my mind.

I got up at quarter to five, let Daisy out and saw the waning crescent moon rising over the river. A 10-15 mph. wind was blowing from the southwest. I drew a low number, went to \#9 pond, set my decoys and settled into the blind about five minutes after shooting time. The sky was clear and the wind fresh; it looked and felt like a textbook opening morning as the sky filled with a spectacular number of ducks. I started poorly, blindsided by ducks coming out of the glare, and hit two ducks at marginal range. One fell in the bay near the slough, but swam away before Daisy could reach it; the other sailed over to Sprig Farm. Then a wing-set duck came over the open water straigt to the island. I fire befored making a sure identification and hit a hen spoonie which landed in the pond upwind from the blind but dove and escaped from Daisy.

Around 8:30, I began to think I'd get skunked on the opening day of the century. "Oh, the horror!"[^1] Then my luck changed. I called in and solidly hit a big drake mallard, a routine retrieve for Daisy. I began to relax and enjoy the morning. A few minutes later, I looked to my left and saw a cock sprig fluttering about 10 feet over the mallard decoys in the bay alongside the island. An easy shot was promptly followed by another routine retrieve. Around 9:30 I called in a pair of teal and bring one down with a quick reaction shot. Daisy quickly found it in the pickleweed east of the pond and brought it to hand.

It was quarter to ten and the world was much brighter. I recalled what John Batley, our woodpigeon guide, said to John and me after a sparse afternoon in Herefordshire: "It's not just about numbers; shooters who think so are missing the point." I decided to pick up and cruise back to the dock, satisfied with the three prime ducks on my strap.

Bag: one mallard, one sprig, one teal.

Other: Shooting was great on some of our ponds, merely good in others. Some members also got less than the limit but everyone came in with at least one or two prime birds.

However, this was not Jim Graziani's weekend. On Saturday he and Mike Corsetti went to \#23 pond. When they shot their first duck, Bandit went out, looked at the bird and then started hunting on his own. He ignored Jim's repeated calls and disappeared. Jim had no idea of where Bandit had gone, his only clue being the occasional "caw-caw-caw" of a startled rooster pheasant. Eventually, Jim left the blind and went back to the boat house to find Bandit waiting for him at the dock. Jim was greatly relieved, but Bandit's frolic had cost him an hour and a half of hunting time.

Jim's misadventures continued. On Sunday, he and Chris Charles went to \#28 and got seven ducks -- and quite a scare on the way in. Because of the strong north wind, they were hugging the shore when Jim's boat struck something that twisted the motor and wrested the throttle out of Jim's grip. As the boat circled out of control, Bandit fell into the water. Meanwhile Chris was holding on to the boat for dear life. As Jim struggled to regain control, the motor died. The wind blew them into the tulles. Jim had trouble restarting the motor and tried to attract attention by firing a series of shots. No one heard them; everybody was in the club room watching the 49'er game. Eventually, Jim managed to get the motor running and he and Chris finally limped back to the dock at 12:30.

Saturday October 28th: Where have they gone?

Jury duty kept me in town but I learned that Wednesday's shoot had been disappointing. Nevertheless, I boarded the Friday afternoon boat with great pleasure and anticipation. Our afternoon walk was unremarkable but dinner was a treat. Steve Pike, our new chef, established his credentials with a beautifully cooked leg of lamb, mashed potatoes prepared with cream and bleu cheese, a tasty melange of squashes followed by banana-filled crepes for desert.

Saturday morning would have stirred the soul of Turner or one of the French Impressionists. The sky was decorated with a variety of upper-level clouds, their subtle colors mirrored in the still waters of \#10 pond. The occasional high flying duck added a touch of motion to the scene. Chris Charles, who had invited Daisy and me to shoot with him, fired one round at a spoonie. He missed. And that, dear readers, was the total morning's action!

Bag: Skunked.

Other: Shooting was poor all over the club. Everyone wondered where the ducks had gone. One clue was furnished by a light plane that flew back and forth over our ponds at about 100 feet. Frank had seen a plane "buzzing" the club a few days before the opener. Had it chased the ducks away?

Wednesday, November 1st: All quiet on the marsh.

A precious few drops rain were falling as Daisy and I took our afternoon walk. We saw only a few birds. Tuesday's dinner was superb, roast chicken, risotto with mushrooms, fresh corn and Chinese peas, followed by banana mousse for desert.

Wednesday morning was less than superb. I went to \#7 only to realize when I reached the blind that I'd forgotten my duck calls. I went back and got them, returned to the blind and was putting in my earplugs when a pair of mallards came overhead at 25 yards. They sailed off undisturbed. The morning was extremely slow. The sky was overcast with a light wind from the west. The sun came out at 9:30. I called flocks of widgeon which made tight circles over the blind at 150 yards but wouldn't come any lower.

Bag: Skunked.

Wednesday, November 8th: A hat trick for the skunk.

I passed up Saturday's shoot and went to Pasadena to see Stanford suffer a agonizing 31-30 last minute loss to USC (moral, there's more than one way to get skunked). Tuesday afternoon was warm and windless; I can not recall a smoother crossing, ever. On our afternoon walk, which Chuck Yirchott shared, we saw ducks in twos and threes, and mosquitoes in the hundreds.

We had a tasty but slightly dry barbecued pork loin for dinner. Wednesday morning was arid! I went to \#28 and fired a grand total of three shots. I called in a flock of teal but didn't fire because they got between me and the sun. Until 9:00 o'clock it was dead calm; then a breeze strong enough to cause ripples on the pond began to blow from the southwest. To cap the morning, a beautiful mallard drake sailed over my decoys but I was crouching down in the barrel and didn't see him in time.

Bag: Skunked.

Other: Dean and Fred met the Tuesday afternoon boat. They reported that shooting was very poor at Sprig Farm. Once again shooting was sparse throughout our club, except for Frank Fiala and Jeff Theibout, they went to \#12 and had nine ducks on their strap by 7:30.

Sunday November 12th: Here's to the Ladies.

Saturday was Ladies' Night. I passed up the morning shoot and that afternoon drove Muriel and Julie Graziani to the dock for a 2:30 boat trip to the Club. Several hunters who were getting off the boat told me I'd missed a terrific shoot, everybody had limited on big birds. Just kidding, of course. The warm weather pattern that had been frustrating us from the first week of the season continued unabated. It was almost dead calm as Muriel and I took Daisy for a two-hour walk on the Division Road. We saw only a few ducks but the sunset was pretty.

Seven couples gathered for Saturday's dinner and the meal proved worthy of the occasion, osso bucco, risotto and tiramissau for desert. After dinner, Muriel and I took Daisy out and watched a red full moon rise through the haze over the marsh.

Muriel and I got up early on Sunday morning and I took her out to \#28 pond to give her a taste of the duck hunting experience. She watched me set decoys and hide the boat; then we settled into the blind and watched the sun come up. Very few ducks were flying and, except for one lesser scaup which I let circle over the decoys and fly off, everything was far out of range. However, Muriel enjoyed observing the other varieties of bird life around the pond. About 9:00 o'clock, I picked up and took her for a boat around the property. I left her by the road at Pelican Point and she and Daisy walked back.

Several large flocks of ducks were resting on the west side ponds. Apparently, they had flown in overnight. We lunched on home-made raviolis followed by Tony Vaccari's rich and delicious pumpkin cheese cake. As we made a smooth crossing back to Bay Point all the ladies remarked about how much they had enjoyed their outing.

Other: Jim Graziani managed to bag two sprig on Saturday morning. Also, two pheasants were taken on the club. That weekend Dean Brubaker was a guest at Marvin Cardoza's club near Los Banos. He hunted for two days and was high Gun -- with one spoonie.

Wednesday, November 15th: A refreshing surprise.

September's weather stretched into November as a strong ridge of high pressure continued to divert storms to the north keeping daytime temperatures well above normal. Only five of us made the Tuesday afternoon crossing; the river was calm with only the barest hint of a breeze. Daisy and I walked out the Mud Slough road to a point opposite blind \#20. We saw a few ducks and as we were returning to the club house, the breeze began to freshen.

Dinner was an unusual treat, grilled polenta covered with chicken in marinara sauce with sauteed peppers on the side. When I took Daisy out after dinner the wind had increased and was blowing out of the southwest. It continued to blow all night. Chris Charles said he heard the building creaking.

On Wednesday morning, I had first choice and chose blind \#12. I'd never shot there and invited Rich Vaccari to come along as my guide. The wind was still fairly hard out of the southwest and it pushed some of the thick fog that was covering the coastal hills over the marsh. The morning was gray, adding to my impression of \#12 pond as a remote and desolate place. Shortly after shooting time, the ducks started flying over the pond. Rich shot very well; once he even downed four ducks with three shots. One of the birds dove and hid in the grass between the inner and outer blinds. Daisy found it and went on point. Rich had never seen a pointing Labrador and he was astounded. I shot well but, unfortunately, not too selectively, bringing down one widgeon and three spoonies. Daisy made several long retrieves but misbehaved herself when she skinned and started to eat one of Rich's ducks. We caught her in time.

We came in with a total of ten ducks, five widgeon, four spoonies and one sprig. Our other shooters did fairly well by recent standards, Mike Corsetti got two sprig at \#15, Chuck Yirhcott got a nice mallard at \#7 and Chris got one at \#9.

Bag: one widgeon and three spoonies.

Saturday, November 18th: Same old story.

There was no change in the weather, and none predicted. Prospects were gloomy as Daisy and I returned from our afternoon walk having seen very few ducks and a multitude of mosquitoes.

Dinner was again excellent, New York steak, garlic mashed potatoes, fresh corn on the cob and walnut brownies for desert. I had a fairly high choice and invited Chris Charles to join me at \#8. The morning passed fairly quickly, thanks to Chris' conversation, rather than the action, which was virtually nonexistent. Chris fired one shot at a spoonie. Period. For us, the morning's most exciting moment was watching Mike Mendez and his guest bring down a pair of sprig at \#10. They looked to us to be shooting extremely high but when we came in, Mike, who is a good judge of range, said the birds were no more than 25 yards high. This is another example of apparent distances being deceiving. The high point of the morning was lunch, chicken pot pie.

Other: Very few good ducks were taken. Frank and Chuck got nothing at \#15; other shooters brought in a potpourri of less than first-class ducks. Al Martinelli's mallard and widgeon at \#4 for 15 shots fired made him the morning's high Gun. After Jim Koeppen, Jr., came in from duck hunting he took Brandy, his chocolate Labrador, out on Mud Slough Road to try for a pheasant. They got skunked, Jim figuratively, Brandy literally. Our return crossing was aromatic.

Bag: Skunked.

Other: There was no mid-week shoot. Given the lack of birds, we decided to stay home and get ready for Thanksgiving.

Saturday, November 25: So what else is new?

Well, a party for one thing. Rich Island hosted this year's marsh party. Probably because it was Thanksgiving weekend, only fifty attended. I spent a good part of the evening talking with Bud Cronin, Rich Island's senior member. The dinner featured home made raviolis and excellent roast beef. The main topic of conversation was the miserable shooting all over the marsh.

Friday afternoon was dismally calm, mild and hazy; Daisy and I saw only one pair of mallards on our afternoon walk. Saturday morning did feel a little more like late fall. Around 8:00 o'clock a fresh wind came up from the southwest and cleared the air. I went to \#4 and fired three shots at a widgeon. There were very few ducks in the air. A pair of widgeon did land in the pond but stayed well out of range.

The trip's high point was Saturday's lunch, fired oysters served with scrambled eggs and spinach. Everybody raved about the meal and even though our fourteen shooters had taken only seven prime ducks during the morning, we left for home in good spirits.

Bag: skunked.

Wednesday, November 29th: A distinguished guest.

The weather stayed the same with little indication of a change. I brought Bill Harding as my guest and on our pre-dinner walk we observed a beautiful sunset and a grand total of three ducks. Tuesday's dinner was one of the season's best, barbecued salmon, cauliflower mashed potatoes, and vegetables consisting of fresh corn, mushrooms and sweet peppers. The table conversation matched the meal. Bill had spent twenty-five years in Naval aviation before retiring in 1965 at the rank of Captain and had flown nearly every type of fighter plane in the service inventory. We stayed at the dinner table for a long time after desert as he recounted some of his adventures wich included night carrier landings and being attacked by ME 109's while he was flying a fire-spotting mission for his cruiser during the Sicily invasion in a Curtiss Seagull, a catapult-launched two seater float biplane.

I took Bill to \#15. There were a good number of ducks in the sky just after shooting time but once again the morning was extremely slow, with only a few more ducks in the air than on the past Saturday. Bill crippled a spoonie which fell in the pond. Daisy chased in as it dove several times, and then disappeared altogether. Daisy and I spent twenty minutes unsuccessfully hunting for it in the fringes of the pond.

Bag: skunked.

Saturday, December 2nd: The winds of change.

Because of the tides, Friday's boat left at 2:30 and we crossed the river under a gray sky with a fresh wind from the southwest. Light rain was forecast for the evening and it looked like the long hoped-for weather change was on the way. Daisy and I took our longest walk ever, past Pelican Point almost to the Sprig Farm boundary. During our two hours out on Division Road, we saw only a few ducks in the sky, but many widgeon and even some sprig in the resting areas between \#8 through \#15 ponds and the road. While walking back in the fading light, we saw a flock of dark geese landing at Rich Island.

The dinner entre was barbecued beef, baked potatoes and asparagus, with tiramissau for desert.

On Saturday morning, I had a low draw, went to \#4 and for a change, did nearly everything right. There was a good wind out of the southwest and I set 13 of my sprig decoys in a cluster about 25 yards out and upwind of the island, with the remaining 11 decoys in single file downwind and out from the cluster. I put 8 teal decoys upwind, the other four downwind, and spread my mallard decoys along the near shore. Many buffleheads and goldenye kept flying around my island. There wasn't much action but the spread did entice a pair of widgeon to land downwind and outside of the decoys. When they got up, they flew over the decoys and well into range. I should have gotten the pair but did solidly hit one which fell close to the blind, a routine retrieve for Daisy. Later a mallard drake landed out in the pond. When it took off, it also flew over the decoys. I hit it with two shots but it sailed across the pond and dropped in the tulles next to \#5 blind. Daisy initially set out but lost the mark. I made the long wade across the pond and set her to work a little downwind of where I had marked the fall. She very quickly found the bird and brought it to hand. Later, a mallard worked the pond for several minutes in response to my widgeon call. The morning was fresh, the sky partly cloudy and all in all, a delightful change from the previous sessions.

I picked up at 9:45 and went over to \#28 to see Chris. He had lost a diver. Daisy hunted the tulles next to Mud Slough road but couldn't find it.

I was delighted to have brought down two ducks with five rounds expended. When I brought my birds into the cleaning shed, I showed the mallard to Jim Graziani and said, "It's been so long since I've gotten one of these, I've forgotten what it is. Jim replied, "It's a giant spoonie, but you can give it to me."

Other: Hooray, hooray, no skunk today! Everyone got one or two good ducks.

Bag: one mallard and one widgeon.

Wednesday, December 6th: Nibbling away.

We made a choppy crossing under partly cloudy skies on Tuesday afternoon, but by the time Daisy and I took our walk the wind had died down. We wandered out along Mud Slough to \#21 and saw about a dozen sprig fly off the dry ground between \#23 and Noyce Slough. Otherwise, only a few mallard pairs were flying.

On Wednesday morning, I decided to try something different. I went to \#8 pond and hunted the island at the southwest end of the pond. There was plenty of cover on the island and concealment was excellent. The sky was partly cloudy with a fresh wind from the southwest. I set my decoys to the west of island with the mallards in the bay upwind, and concentrated the teal decoys near the island. This attracted some birds. I downed two teal with two shots, Daisy made routine retrieves. On the minus side, I missed three shots at another flock of teal I called in and also failed to react in time to two sprig that came right over the island. (I assumed that only spoonies would come so readily to my decoys.) However, after so many barren mornings, I was contented. Our other shooters didn't do very well, except for Rich Vaccari, who got five ducks at \#7.

Bag: 2 teal.

Saturday, December 9th: First taste of winter.

Friday afternoon was hazy, chill and damp; fog was forecast for the morning. Daisy, Chris and I walked out the west side road and saw more ducks flying than in recent weeks. Al White, Tom Lucas, Fred Ellers and Fred Foster came down Sprig Farm to join us for a wonderful cioppino dinner; there was plenty to eat, all of it delicious. After dinner, I saw the fog forming on the river.

Saturday morning was a pleasant surprise. The sky was overcast and a fairly cold wind was blowing out of the northeast, but horizontal visibility was one mile. It really felt like winter. I went to \#26A (some questioned the choice) and set my sprig decoys well out in the pond, concentrated my teal decoys about 15 yards north of the island and put all my mallards in the bay next to the levee. This worked very well. I called in three flocks of teal and shot one bird out each of the first two flocks with one cartridge, but missed three shots at the third flock. Fortunately, I saw a large wing-set mallard coming into the mallard decoys and brought it down with my second shot. Daisy hardly got her feet wet.

Other: Shooting was spotty all over the club; Jim Koeppen and Les Vaccari got nine ducks at \#12; Jim Graziani and George Couch brought in two mallards and two teal at \#15. However, Bandit fumbled on the goal line. He'd made a long retrieve on a mallard but dropped it a foot from Jim's hand. The bird scurried into the water and was never seen again. One or two birds were taken at each blind except \#28, where Mike Murrison got skunked. Also, Rich Pike went out on the east side after breakfast and got a mallard, a widgeon and a ring-neck at \#21.

Bag: 2 teal and 1 mallard.

Saturday, December 16th: Return engagement.

I had first choice and fortunately, Bill Harding was free to come back to St. Germain. Friday afternoon was partly cloudy; a west wind made the crossing a little choppy. We took a short walk on the west side and saw only a pair of mallards and a pair of spoonies.

Bill and I went to \#12. I put him on the large island near the boat ditch and took the blind out in the pond called "the point." It was a very pretty day on the marsh. The morning was partly cloudy and so clear I felt I could almost touch the surrounding hills. Bill said fliers call this "severe clear." We were fortunate to see more ducks than I'd seen since the opener. Four mallards came over Bill before he was ready to shoot. I called in two flocks of teal and downed one bird with two shots each time. There were lots of birds on and over the pond but they were sea ducks. Bill downed a teal and a ringneck with single shots. Later we both missed shots at birds well within range. Around 9:30 a flock circled the pond. I first tried the sprig call but they didn't seem interested. I changed to the widgeon call with the same result. Finally I blew the teal call and they came right over Bill's blind. He missed three shots, but as they came over me, I downed -- guess what -- a hen sprig. Daisy chased it around the pond and, when it swam near the island, I administered the coupe de grace. We were high guns for the morning.

Bag: 2 teal and 1 sprig.

Wednesday, December 20th: Dog daze.

The weather provided some drama and canine antics lent a touch of spice to what was otherwise a very bland morning. In brief, I had bottom choice, went to \#4 and got duly and properly skunked. Meanwhile, Larry Godwin and Rich Vaccari enjoyed a fine shoot up the pond at \#7. Twice when ducks were working to my call, they shot at birds over their heads and scared mine away. However, I can't complain because they brought down ducks each time. They came in with six teal and one mallard and were high Guns.

Shortly after shooting time a thick fog formed and reduced visibility to less than 200 yards. Then at 8:30 a wind came up from the south and moved it away in a dramatic manner. Looking to the south, I saw clear blue sky and the hills across the river in brilliant relief while to the north, an almost impenetrable wall of fog shrouded half the pond and obscured the far blind.

Now to the dog news. Jim Graziani's guest, Andy Stone, brought along his six year-old yellow labrador named Rocky, who "endeared" himself to the membership by barking all night. Like his cinematic namesake, Rocky never quit. Next morning out in the blind with Jim and Andy, Rocky whined continuously; Jim described the sound as a backward widgeon call. When Jim or Andy fired, Rocky ignored the ducks and retrieved the empty cartridge cases.

And there's more. Tulle, for the first time in her career, devoured a spoonie at \#12 where she was hunting with Frank and Jim Koeppen. The most likely explanation is stress induced by sleep deprivation. When Frank returned to the dock, he said to Andy, "Let me look at that dog's throat. I want to see if he has any vocal cords left."

Fortunately, Daisy had enjoyed a good night's sleep in my boat locker, for she had an arduous morning. She chased a crippled teal all the way across the pond to the rushes next to \#5, but couldn't find it. We went back after I picked up and hunted the area for another half-hour without any success. She slept well again on Wednesday night.

The return crossing was remarkably smooth; the river water was muddy brown because of run-off from the previous week's rain.

Bag: Skunked.

Saturday, December 23rd: Why we go duck hunting.

Last-minute Christmas shoppers and holiday travelers made Friday's traffic far worse than usual and it was a relief to reach the dock. Fog on the river reduced visibility to no more than a mile. Fourteen shooters attended; we knew that many new birds had arrived on the marsh. However, Friday evening was dreary and thick fog was predicted for the morning.

Friday's festivities provided a happy contrast to the gloomy weather. We enjoyed a roast beef dinner followed by Muriel's plum pudding. I poured a pint of brandy over it and Jim Graziani flambed it while singing "I don't want to set world on fire." After desert we sampled Chris Charles' home-made liqueur and sat round the table singing Christmas carols. Frank announced that the plum pudding is now an official St. Germain tradition.

What a pleasant surprise on Saturday morning! When I took Daisy out on the levee for her morning walk and biscuit, I saw the lights of Antioch in the east and Fairfield in the northwest. The fog had lifted; visibility was great.

I invited Jim to shoot with me at \#8 but he was fighting a cold and decided to sleep in. The morning was dark and I became disoriented in the pond and lost some time trying to find the main island. A fairly strong wind was blowing out of the east. I set all my teal decoys right next to the island. I put two groups of sprig a little further out in the pond, six drakes and one hen in each group. I set all my mallards immediately downwind (but later moved them upwind) and settled down to enjoy the best shoot of the season. From shooting time until 9:00 o'clock there were plenty of ducks flying. I called in a number of teal, singly and in flocks. I downed four but missed shots at several others. At one point excitement overwhelmed my judgment. A flock of at least twenty teal came in to my call and I committed the amateur blunder of trying to "flock shoot," the guaranteed prescription for missing birds. Had I kept my wits about me, I would achieved a limit of teal. In any event, it was a satisfying morning.

Other shooters did fairly well; Frank and Mike Mendez were high guns at \#12 and no blind was skunked.

Bag: four teal.

Wednesday, December 27th: Score one for the teal.

Tuesday afternoon was virtually calm and relatively warm for December. Daisy and I took a short stroll on the Division Road and observed a pair of mallards in \#1 pond. We met a Rich Island hunter walking back to his club; he had seen two dozen sprig on our \#7 pond. Our dinner of linguini and clams was so delicious I had seconds.

On Wednesday morning I took Jim Graziani, Jim's son Ed and Ed's friend Jack to \#8 pond. I chose the far island, Jim took the blind by the entrance and we settled the two young men in the center island double blind. Several flocks of teal came to my call but I couldn't hit a single one. The tall cover on the island bothered me a little but I suppose it simply wasn't my morning. The morning was clear and calm until 9:00 o'clock. I had a sprig working my decoys until someone on the middle island fired at it. Jim got one teal and Jack bagged a mallard just after shooting time, and a teal later in the morning.

Shooting was quiet all over the club. Larry Godwin had an unusual experience at \#28 pond. He was fogged in for half an hour. This fog was highly localized. Although the shooters on the east side mentioned seeing it, the fog didn't extend to any other blind.

Bag: Skunked.

Saturday, December 30th: Last hunt of 1995.

Friday's weather was the definition of dreary. Fog on the river cut visibility to less than one-half mile and a light rain discouraged walking. I took a very short stroll, cut some brush and settled Daisy in the boat locker well before twilight. Jim Koeppen, who had stayed over since Tuesday, reported that most of the ducks had flown off the marsh.

Friday's dinner, which featured corned beef according to Chris Charles' recipe and the customary cabbage and boiled potatoes, was one more fine St. Germain dining experience. I'd been delegated to select a special beer for the meal and purchased two cases of Black Dog Ale; this was well received. Al Martinelli asked me whether I'd brought up the Black Dog; I replied, "Albert, you know I always bring the black dog."

By Saturday morning the fog had lifted. I went to \#8 and brought my radio to listen to the Stanford game. (They lost to East Carolina 19-13.) This was just about the only action; there were very few ducks flying at shooting time. I did have a teal land in my decoys but it flew off before I could shoot. About 9:00 o'clock the fog came in from the north. Just before this I called in a flock of teal and downed one which Daisy retrieved. A short time later, I mistakenly shot a bufflehead which had turned and come in to my teal call. A few other ducks flew by in the fog; they were either spoonies or out of range. All in all, it was not an exciting morning. Shooting was slow all over the club although Mike Corsetti and Jim Koeppen got a couple of big ducks at \#23. Jim lost another sprig because an otter grabbed it before he could get to it.

Bag: one teal and one bufflehead

New Year's Interlude.

Muriel and I had a most enjoyable New Year's celebration at St. Germain together with Chris and Cindy Charles, Jim and Lena Koeppen and Larry and Jean Godwin. Frank deserves special mention for getting out of a sick bed to take us over on Sunday afternoon. We crossed the river at 1:00 o'clock under a crystal clear sky. After we unpacked, Muriel and I set out on a walk around the club, up Mud Slough Road, behind Sprig Farm to Pelican Point, and returning along the Division Road. We covered about seven miles, stayed out three hours and saw a fair number of ducks. For the first time, I saw the view of Grizzly Bay from Pelican Point. We returned to the clubhouse after sunset, tired, thirsty and looking forward to dinner.

Dinner did not disappoint. While we were enjoying the outdoors, Chris Charles had spent hours preparing a feast consisting of sauteed dove breasts, asparagus salad, steak, lobster tails, creamed corn, baked potatoes with Cindy's superb chocolate cake for desert, all accompanied by some very nice Champagne. We retired around 10:00, tired and satisfied.

I had thought about going out to hunt in the morning, but stayed in bed until 7:00. I quietly got up, let Daisy out and then the two of us took a boat ride around the club. I parked for awhile in the \#7-10 blind channel and watched the birds going in and out of the ponds. Muriel was up when I came in so we walked over to Wheeler Island and talked to some shooters who had enjoyed a fairly successful morning. Jim and Julie Graziani brought the boat over at 11:00 and joined us for brunch, prepared by Chris and featuring Chris' home made sausage and bacon. Afterward, Muriel and I took another short boat ride before leaving for home.

Wednesday, January 3rd: Snookered by the fog.

Tuesday afternoon's 69 degrees was unseasonably warm for San Francisco, but at the McAvoy dock the temperature was in the law 60's and the haze on the river was so dense that it bordered on fog. We waited about ten minutes for Rich our chef, then left without him. (He caught the Wheeler Island boat at 4:30.) Daisy and I walked out to the gate, saw nothing flying, but did hear some mallards and sprig on our ponds.

I got to bed later than usual. We had delayed dinner to watch the Nebraska-Florida game. After dinner, as I was putting Daisy to bed in the boat locker, she had a very large drink of water so I had to wait an extra half-hour before settling her down for the night.

I picked \#8 on Wednesday morning but on the way out, I found myself in extremely thick fog which cut visibility to less than 100 yards. I thought to myself, "I've been hunting on this marsh long enough to know that shooting will be impossible in a fog like this." I turned around, navigated back to the dock by hugging the shore, rested in my room and didn't go back until the fog began to lift at 7:00 o'clock. The other shooters said the fog bank only extended between the \#4 and \#7-10 entrances, that it was clear at the north end of the slough and that there had been good shooting during the first forty-five minutes.

There was very little wind until 10:00 o'clock. Then it blew from the southwest at about 10-15 mph. The action was slow; most of the ducks that came over were spoonies. I called in and downed one teal and missed shots at two others. Shortly after 10;00 o'clock I hit a sprig at long range. It came down in the pond and swam to the pickleweed on the west side. Daisy and I hunted it for about 40 minutes without success.

Bag: one teal.

Other: Jim Graziani and George Bignotti had a fairly good shoot at \#12, two sprig and one teal. Tim Murphy and his son Ryan did well at \#23 with a mallard, two sprig, a teal and two ring-necks. Otherwise, shooting was slow with a total of 14 prime ducks taken by 12 shooters. On Wednesday afternoon we met some Wheeler Island shooters at the McAvoy dock; they'd had a fine morning and averaged four birds per Gun.

Saturday, January 6th: A most satisfying morning.

Kevin Scarpelli was my guest and I was hoping to show him a good shoot. Friday afternoon wasn't promising; the sky was hazy without a breath of wind. Kevin and I took Daisy for a walk out to \#1 pond. We saw a grand total of four ducks in the sky and one on the pond. Kevin and Jim Koeppen spent the cocktail hour reminiscing about their baseball days; then we feasted on roast chicken and pasta.

Except for a patch of fog mid way up the slough, Saturday morning was clear, but windless. I took Kevin to \#15 and a few minutes after shooting time, the ducks started flying, more than I'd seen all season. My teal call was working and, Kevin, who likes teal as much as I, had plenty of shooting opportunities. He missed a few times but soon figured out the lead and began to hit consistently. His Remington 1100 with a 26 in. skeet barrel was well suited for the close in, fast flying targets. We accounted for six teal and one widgeon. Daisy made two outstanding long distance retrieves. On the first, she found a teal with had flown two hundred yards before dropping into the nut grass behind the blind; on the second, she pursued a diving widgeon across the pond and into the pickleweed. There were plenty of big ducks in the sky which responded to my whistle, but they kept out of range and landed in and around the pond. I saw more ducks in the sky this morning that at any time during the past two seasons and I was delighted that Kevin was able to enjoy not only St. Germain's food, facilities and fellowship, but also an excellent shoot. Needless to say, he wants to come back.

Bag: three teal.

Wednesday, January 10th: "I'm Building Up To An Awful Let- Down."

The title of this 1936 song, lyrics by Fred Astaire, music by Johnny Mercer, neatly summarizes this shoot. Tuesday afternoon had been a textbook winter day, overcast, cold east wind and one mile visibility. I took advantage of a 2:00 o'clock boat and spent over an hour out on the marsh, enthralled by the many flights of ducks (mostly teal) going in, out and over our ponds. Wednesday was going to be glorious. Or so I thought.

The weather changed, the morning dawned clear, cloudless., windless and alas, virtually duckless. I took Jim Graziani and his guests Richard and Michael Flocchini to \#8 pond and as before, took the far island. The morning was extremely slow. There were very few ducks to be seen, let alone fired at. I did have three opportunities at teal, but missed each time. One was particularly humiliating. A teal landed in my decoys and flew straight up. I did everything wrong, rushing the first shots and then forgetting to pivot and remount the gun for a going away shot.

Although totally unexciting, the morning did its comic moments. Bandit, who was supposed to be with Jim at the entrance blind, made a circuit of the pond, paying social calls on the Flocchini's in the center blind and then swimming over to visit Daisy and me. Later, the strains of "Danny Boy" drifted across the pond. Jim was playing the tune on his Wingsetter call.

Bag: skunked.

Other: Tuesday's dinner featured roast top round of buffalo, kindly contributed by Richard Flocchini from the family ranch in Wyoming. Slowly cooked to rare (325 degree oven), roast buffalo is tender, delicious, and surprisingly, has less cholesterol than skinless chicken.

Blinds \#7 and \#15 shot well. Nearly everyone else had a disappointing morning, although some shooters brought in one or two teal. Except for Rick the chef. He walked over to \#1 pond with a borrowed gun and no decoys -- and bagged six big ducks in less than an hour.

Saturday, January 13th: Erratic shooting and a maritime misadventure.

The weather remained stagnant over northern California as persistent high pressure over the Nevada-Utah basin diverted the flow of winter storms northward. Fog remained in place over the marsh; fortunately visibility extended to approximately three quarters of a mile and the wind was from the east. Once again, I took the 2:00 o'clock boat and was able to enjoy an hour and a half out on the marsh, watching the ducks on our west side ponds. The wind was so cold that I put Daisy in the boat room before dinner.

On Saturday morning, the fog remained light and shooting conditions were almost ideal. I went to \#4, set my decoys and was ready about ten minutes after shooting time. At the outset, I missed two birds, then brought down a widgeon hen. Daisy had to spend about ten minutes chasing it as it kept diving in the pond before she finally caught it. After that I had no difficulty calling in flight after flight of teal; the problem was I couldn't hit them. I shot at least 25 rounds at teal without result, except I now understand why golfers sometimes wrap their clubs around trees. I was so upset that I even let several ducks fly overhead without firing. Around quarter to ten, while I was lamenting my abysmal shooting, a pair of widgeon crossed the pond about 45 yards out. I picked out one, mounted the gun, swung through and brought it down with one shot. It fell dead at the edge of the pond near Division Road. (Tim Murphy, who was shooting at the far end of the pond in \#7, thought a trespasser was hunting on the road.) Daisy swam directly to it and brought it in. My confidence revived and a few minutes later, I fired three shots at a high sprig which set its wings and came down two hundred yards away toward \#3 pond. Daisy and I set out after it. As we neared the spot where I thought it fell, she became increasingly "birdy." Then she went into a clump of tulles and brought it out. I told Daisy she'd done a marvelous piece of dog work, then said, "Let's end the morning on a high note." I picked up and went in. Shooting had been fair to good throughout the club. Tim Murphy and Mike Murrison got a mixed limit at \#7.

Bag: two widgeon and one sprig.

After a lunch of steak sandwiches, we were tired and ready to leave for Bay Point. However, the tide didn't accommodate our schedule. The boat was stuck in the mud and despite all efforts, it couldn't clear the channel. About 3:00 the water level had raised and we set out for home. However, when we were about 300 yards off Wheeler Island, the motor overheated and smoke filled the cabin. There we were, drifting powerless in mid-river. Mike Mendez made several calls on his cellular phone but got no answer. At Jim Graziani's suggestion, I blew the SOS on the air horn. The Wheeler Island boat responded and towed us to McAvoy. We reached the dock at 5:00 p.m.

Wednesday, January 17th: A lucky find.

The weather finally changed. The tail end of a vigorous storm was passing through the Bay Area as we arrived at the dock for the 2:00 o'clock boat. I brought a guest, Brett Morris, a colleague in the Correctional Law Section of the Attorney's General's Office. Brett had also worked for Fish and Game and he was eagerly looking forward to the St. Germain experience.

The wind was blowing hard out of the west and our crossing was the roughest of the season, with waves breaking over the bow, veritably an "E Ticket" ride. We walked out on the west side, saw only a few ducks and conjectured that the storm had blown most of the birds off the marsh.

I took Brett up the Sprig Farm for cocktails, introduced him to Dean, Alan and Bill Armstrong, and showed him my old room. After its renovation, the old clubhouse almost sparkled. After an hour of scotch, smoked salmon and nostalgia, we returned to St. Germain. The sky was absolutely clear and the wind, which had shifted to the southwest, was so strong that I ran under reduced speed to keep the boat under control.

Back at St. Germain we dined on roast pork and, after I'd given Daisy her evening walk and good-night biscuit, lights out.

I had a low draw but \#8 was available and that's where we went. The morning was beautifully clear with a light wind from the southwest. However, only a few ducks were part of the scenery. A flock of geese came within 200 yards of the island. I called in some birdys which circled but stayed just out of range. I fired three shots at a widgeon which set its wings and sailed a long distance. Brett shot one of a pair of teal which came in to my call; Daisy promptly retrieved it. At 10:45 we left the blind I made a short detour to show Brett \#12 pond. By the entrance to Sprig Farm's \#3 pond, we saw a freshly killed widgeon which I grabbed and put on the strap. This could have been the bird I had hit earlier. On the way in, we paid a call on Dean and Bill while they were picking up their decoys in Sprig Farm's \#2 pond. Dean had downed a widgeon and a spoonie.

After cleaning our birds, we enjoyed a lunch of fried oysters, spinach and scrambled eggs. The return crossing was calm and scenic. Brett commented that it didn't matter to him that the shooting was poor; he'd spent a wonderful 24 hours in a special place.

Other: Frank and Chuck Yirchott had a good shoot. Rich Vaccari slept on board the St. Germain Tuesday night and said he got a good rest.

Bag: one widgeon, maybe.

Saturday, January 20th: A fitting finale.

Saturday's shoot, the final one for me, was a cameo of the season, a season of great expectations but meager results. One concern was allayed, the weather pattern, which was stagnant for most of the season had definitely changed with a series of storms that brought much-needed rain. It was delightful to see the hills turning green.

The crossing, while choppy, was nowhere near as rough as Wednesday's. The sky was partly cloudy as Daisy and I took our final afternoon walk, and saw a few large flocks of ducks high in the distant north, heading toward the west. It had rained hard on Thursday and more rain was predicted for late Saturday, this last shoot would be in the "window" between the two storms. Frank and Chuck had stayed at the club on Wednesday, and had good results on Friday morning. Chris and Mike Corsetti went over on Thursday afternoon, but fared poorly on Friday.

We had a full house for Friday's dinner, the traditional end-of-season prime rib roast, and the atmosphere was unusually exuberant. I retired a little before ten and slept soundly.

I had second draw and invited Chris to join me at blind \#15. We each took our boats. While I was hiding my boat at the edge of the pond, Chris was walking to the island. Daisy gave him a ferocious growl. She had done the same to Rich Vaccari the day we hunted \#12 pond. Chris was a little unnerved, but when he said, "Daisy, it's only me!" she calmed down.

The morning was one of the prettiest of the year, fresh wind from the south, a variety of clouds preceding the storm which was approaching from the northwest. There were enough ducks in the sky to sustain our interest, but only a few shooting opportunities. I had the last laugh on the teal, bringing one down with a 40 yard crossing shot. The bird fell near the boat and ran into the pickleweed. Daisy, in an impressive example of dog work, chased it down and brought it in. Later, I called in a flock of teal and Chris hit one solidly with an impressive reaction shot, which I didn't see. It fell dead in the water. I saw Daisy acting excitedly and told her stay. Chris wondered why I wouldn't let her get his duck. When I realized he had a bird down, I sent her and she made a nice 50-yard retrieve. In the course of the morning, I called in two pairs of big ducks which came overhead, but we failed to connect. However, despite the sparse results, we both enjoyed the morning. Chris gave me some much appreciated help bagging my decoys.

Bag: one teal.

Season's results: 3 mallard, 3 sprig, 17 teal, 4 widgeon, 3 spoonies and 1 bufflehead for a total of 31. (87% prime ducks)

Final reflections: Saturday afternoon's lowering sky promised more rain that evening; good riddance to the stagnant weather pattern and the threat of a dry winter. I drove home with mixed feelings, melancholy that the season was ended mixed with feelings of contentment, rather like finishing a bottle of fine wine and knowing one has had enough. In terms of numbers, the season was disappointing. October's great expectations remained unfulfilled. Yet even this disappointment was mixed with the satisfaction of knowing the duck population was truly increasing. Also, I had thoroughly enjoyed my first season as a full member of St. Germain, and particularly enjoyed sharing the experience with my guests. The camaraderie at the club and the great food had helped compensate for the generally sparse shooting. There was further satisfaction in knowing that time spend in reconnaissance is never wasted[^2], my hours out walking with Daisy had taught me much about the physical layout of the club, knowledge I hope to put to good use in coming years.

May all of you have an enjoyable off-season.
