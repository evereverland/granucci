**1991-92 SPRIG FARM DIARY**

(or, "Daisy's Sophomore Year")

Introduction: This is the third season for my duck hunting journal. It is dedicated to all those who make our club the fine place that it is. Naturally, my observations are just one part of Sprig Farm's story and I hope that these notes will encourage other members to record and share their experiences. The reader is cautioned that all references to distances and wind speeds are very rough approximations.

Saturday October 26th -- A Great Opening Day.

The excitement started building on Tuesday the 22nd, when a weak storm front brought a little rain and cooler weather. A major storm was forecast for the weekend and, in happy contrast to the recent drought years, the forecast was right. I had great hopes for this season's weather and at least for the opener, they were fulfilled.

Friday's drive to the marsh featured a grey overcast sky heralding a major storm, and a few showers. I opened the sun roof and really enjoyed the drive in although I did not see many ducks. Approximately 75 vehicles were lined up at the check stand. The process of moving in consumed most of the afternoon, but I took a half-hour walk with Daisy in the rain. A fresh wind was blowing from the south and, unlike the past few years, the mosquitoes were no problem. However, I saw only about a half a dozen ducks on our ponds.

Friday's festivities were up to usual standards. Salmon Mousse a la Monteith and fresh shrimps, followed by barbecued steak and Harri Monteith's apple strudel for desert. Fourteen of our sixteen members were at dinner. The new members were enthusiastic about the club.

I drew eleventh choice and, because of the stormy weather, selected Blind \#1. On Saturday morning I took my time getting to the pond, placed six decoys along the shore in the lee of the little hill, and brought another six out to the island. The wind was from the southwest at 15-20 knots with moderate rain. Shooting time was 6:59 but I wasn't ready until 7:15. Just as I loaded my gun and settled into the barrel, the sky filled with ducks. My first shot brought down a hen mallard. After this, I had to be careful and passed up many opportunities for big birds because the gray sky made identification next to impossible. My next two rounds brought down two teal, no identification difficulty there. I made a couple of half-hearted tries at high ducks but finally realized that this is no way to shoot. Then I settled back and waited for the light to improve. Ducks kept coming off the state ponds, flying upwind across our east side ponds and over my blind. The action slowed around 8;15 but it didn't matter. The scenery was beautiful, there was a rainbow over \#2 and it was a pleasure to watch the rain drenching the drought-parched hills. At 10:00 I fired one shot and brought down what looked like a sprig; it turned out to be a drake widgeon.

Daisy has definitely improved. She is much quieter on the island and, after only one strong warning, left the decoys alone.

Bag: 1 mallard, 2 teal and 1 widgeon.

Other: Fred Ellers went to \#5 and found the barrel full of fleas. An otter had been living on the island.

Once again, Blind 1 proved its worth in stormy weather. Blinds 3, 6, 7, 8, and 14 shot well; blinds 2, 5, 5A, 9 and 15 didn't.

A larger than usual number of Fish & Game trucks were parked at the ranger station on Friday afternoon. Hence, on Saturday I wasn't surprised that when two game wardens stopped me at the main (yellow) gate. They quickly checked my license and birds, looked inside my shooting box, asked where I had been shooting, and bid me a good trip home.

Wednesday, October 30th -- Early Season Doldrums.

Tuesday afternoon was partly cloudy and hazy; the early season doldrums had set in. I took a ride with Dean to help pump out Blinds 2 and 6. We saw a fair number of mallards get up from the area between \#6 and \#9. I took a walk along the west side road and saw some ducks on the state ponds opposite \#7, but very few in the air. The mosquitoes weren't as bad as last year, but they made their presence known. By sundown the wind had died down.

A strong north wind was predicted for Wednesday morning, so I chose Blind 1. It was a good move. When I went to bed, the weather radio was reporting strong north winds at Redding, although our part of the valley was still calm. At 2:00 a.m., I was awakened by the rattles and shaking of the clubhouse; the wind had reached Sprig Farm.

I got to \#1 well before shooting time and set most of my decoys next to the lee shore (behind the little hill) and about a dozen decoys in the lee of the island. About ten minutes after shooting time, the ducks started flying; the problem was that they were much too high. The wind stayed strong all morning but there were very few birds in the air, except for the spoonies which kept coming in low over the blind. About 8:30, four or five mallards decoyed over the pond, heading for the lee shore. I picked out a drake but needed two rounds to bring it down, and so missed the chance for a double. About an hour later, I brought down a duck I thought might be a teal, it turned out to be a very small spoonie. Daisy made two routine retrieves. The morning was very slow (not unusual for the first part of the season). I came in at 10:30, disappointed by the lack of action, but satisfied that \#1 is an excellent north wind blind and that my decoy placement was appropriate.

Bag: 1 mallard and 1 spoonie.

Other: By and large, the other shooters didn't fare very well. Al White was skunked at \#5; Mike Ryan and Jeff Smith got 2 spoonies at \#2. However, Bill Armstrong doubled on mallards at \#6.

On Tuesday afternoon and again in Wednesday morning, I saw a flight of swans.

Saturday November 2nd -- Surprising Results.

Friday's warm, hazy and almost windless afternoon brought back memories of last season. I hope this doesn't portend another year of drought. There were many spoonies on the marsh; last year they didn't arrive until late December. Mike Monteith and I walked along the outside road and saw quite a few ducks in the area between Blinds 7 and 8. More birds were flying than on the previous Tuesday.

I had second choice and chose Blind 8. I towed Mike M. to \#7 (his motor wouldn't start) and was settled in my blind about ten minutes after shooting time. It didn't matter. There were very few birds in the air at that time. Except for the spoonies which kept flying over my decoys all morning, the day was extremely slow. The sky was cloudless and hazy but a fresh breeze from the north kept the morning from being totally dreary.

Overall, conditions were dismal. However, a few opportunities came along and, believe it or not, I hit everything I shot at, except for wasting two rounds on a pair of widgeon which were clearly out of range. The secret is to concentrate on a proper gun mount, point behind the bird and swing through. This makes it easier to keep the gun moving. Daisy lost two ducks; one dove on her, the other flew away when she approached. I also had to go out and help her find a sprig which fell on the north side of the pond. Lesson: never let conditions discourage you from going duck hunting.

Bag: 1 sprig, 1 widgeon, 1 spoonie.

Other: On Tuesday, Fred Ellers took a boat ride to \#3 and saw "a carpet of mallards" on the St. Germain pond to the west across Noyes slough. The ducks were very reluctant to leave that pond. Coincidentally, a number of mallards we've cleaned have been eating corn.

Mike Ryan brought up his Duck Grade Winchester 21. I've always liked the Winchester 21 and enjoyed seeing this one. It has 30 in. barrels which give it the feel of a tubed skeet gun (the better to keep a swing going).

Friday's dinner featured perfectly cooked London Broil.

On an after dinner walk with Daisy, I heard an eerie sound floating across the marsh, a pack of dogs barking in the night. This probably came from Rich Island.

Daisy likes to chase rabbits. As long as she breaks off

at the whistle, there's no harm in it and it's good exercise for her.

Wednesday, November 6th -- Hot Weather, Cold Shooting

Tuesday afternoon was warm and the mosquitoes were out. However, Mt. Diablo was clearly visible. Fred Ellers and I took a boat ride out to \#3 and observed the pond across the slough. There were several hundred ducks there and we watched ducks drop into that poind without the slightest hesitation. Fred said there were even more ducks there last Friday. He decided to try Blind 4 for the pass shooting. I took Daisy for a short walk; we went a hundred yards or so past the gate along the east side and then turned back because of the combination of mosquitoes and lack of ducks in the air.

I managed to get Blind 8 even though I had a low draw. I set some mallard decoys along the east shore. a combination of mallard and sprig decoys around the island, and 10 sprig decoys in a straight line about 30 yards out parallel to the island. The morning was clear and calm and at shooting time, there were no ducks in the air. About 10 minutes later, a few birds started flying and until about 8:00 o'clock, the blind was fairly interesting. As on the previous Saturday, spoonies kept coming to my decoys and landing in the pond but I recognized them and held fire. I also saw, and this is unusual, flocks of bluebills flying around. I did waste a half a box of shells firing at ducks at extreme range (if not out of range). One of the birds landed in the house pond. Daisy and I walked over there and searched the area, but couldn't find it.

Around 9:00 o'clock, a flock of widgeon landed just inside the line of decoys, about 30 yards west of the blind. I stood up and shot a drake which fell 200 yards down the pond. Daisy swam out to retrieve it, then turned back. I waded out with her about half way and she made the retrieve. By 10:00 o'clock it was warm and there was nothing flying, so I came in.

All of the shooters agreed that it was an extremely slow morning. Bob Voydat was high gun with a mallard, a sprig, a widgeon and a bluebill. Dean also shot a bluebill (they're at their best served with tartar sauce).

Bag: 1 widgeon.

Other: Joe served swiss steak for dinner on Tuesday. It was a good as ever.

Fred had absolutely no action at \#4. When took his boat across the slough, he saw the neighboring pond that had been full of ducks the previous afternoon was empty. He moved to \#10 and got a sprig and a widgeon.

Al White said he has heard a coyote howling. Joe said there may be a wild dog pack on the marsh. People from town leave stray dogs there.

Wednesday, November 13th -- A Beautiful Morning for the Skunk

I skipped Saturday to watch Stanford beat UCLA. It was a good move; our Saturday shoot was the worst of the season, a total of eight ducks of which six were spoonies. Dean was high gun, two doubles on spoonies for five rounds expended. He said that the marsh party at St. Germain was great; they served venison, quail, ham, roast beef and plenty of liquid refreshments. However all the clubs were lamenting the lack of shooting so far this season.

Tuesday afternoon was mild and hazy, with Mt. Diablo barely visible from the clubhouse. Daisy and I went with Dean to pump out Blind \#2, and then took a boat ride out to see the "mystery pond" opposite \#3. Once again, it was full of big ducks. Dean said that St. Germain had heavily burned the area and this really attracts the ducks. Fish and Game have been aware of this area for years and still can't understand why the ducks seem to love it.

Even with next to last draw, I managed to get Blind \#8. Aesthetically, Wednesday morning was outstanding. A fresh 10-20 knot west wind with a partly cloudy sky and a beautiful sunrise made it a joy simply to be out on the marsh. The view of the surrounding hills was magnificent and only one ingredient for a perfect day was missing -- ducks! Even the spoonies which had created a little interest last Wednesday were absent. I passed up a chance at two scaup and fired at a widgeon that was 60 yards overhead and that was my morning. Even Daisy is regressing; she's started retrieving decoys again. I packed up at 10:05 and took an hour's boat ride before coming in.

After lunch Daisy and I went with Alan White to look for a downed mallard behind \#14. We were unsuccessful.

Other; The skunk also visited Blinds \#9 (Dean), \#7 (Paul Dali) and \#15 (Bob Voydat). Alan White got 2 mallards at \#14 and \#6 had some shooting.

Saturday November 16th -- Skunked Again

A settlement conference delayed me on Friday and I didn't the marsh after sunset. The sky was crystal clear and the twilight sky was glowing red. Two skunks were loitering by the yellow gate (a portent of the morrow). Fortunately the gate was open and I drove right through without stopping. Dinner featured cornish game hens, a long-time favorite among the members. After dinner, Mike Ryan and I took a mile walk. The evening was delightful, bright lights along the horizon, the clear starry sky and the fresh, delicious air. Also, there were fewer mosquitoes.

I chose Blind \#7 and set my decoys around the island. It was an idle exercise. I had two spoonies in range which I passed up, and on three occasions fired at ducks that were well out of range. However, unlike the past Wednesday, there were some ducks in the air; the problem is that they were a mile high. Around 9:00 o'clock the action came to a grinding halt. I packed up at 10:15 and took a circuitous boat ride back to the clubhouse. At noontime, the score was as follows: Fred Ellers (\#10) high gun with two spoonies, Bill Armstrong (\#8) second with one spoonie shot at 80 yards, everybody else got skunked, including Mike Ryan, who went back to \#1 in the afternoon.

Other: I heard a coyote howling on Friday night.

Fred Ellers has observed many ducks on the west side of the marsh. This area is owned by the state and is not being shot.

Observations: I enjoyed Blind \#7. However, the cover is much too high on the west side of the island. This cuts off the view to the west and, on sunny days, requires one to face into the glare.

I think we're all ready for the interval. The lack of action on these past three shoots has been disappointing. However, the weather does seem to be changing and, if the predicted storm arrives during Thanksgiving week, our fortunes may revive during the second half of the season.

Saturday November 30th -- Good Game Plan, Poor Execution

The storm that was predicted for Thanksgiving week fizzled out; the drought still prevails. Friday was very windy. Dean, Alan White, Fred Ellers and I had lunch at Fairfield and then shot sporting clays at Birds Landing. The 20-30 mph winds made shooting extremely difficult. Stations that I had mastered last time were virtually impossible. Dean, Fred and I shot about equal scores; Al outclassed us all with a 57.

I arrived at Sprig Farm about 4:30 and took Daisy for a short walk. There were more ducks on the club than in past weeks and it was delightful not to have the mosquitoes around.

The strong north winds were predicted to continue on Saturday and having first choice, I made a calculated decision and chose Blind \#1 instead of \#8. I have never had a really successful shoot in a north wind a wanted to try a special scheme for setting decoys.

Saturday morning was clear, very windy, but not too cold. I got to \#1 in plenty of time and set all of my decoys very close together along the north shore, except for four mallard decoys I placed in the lee of the island. This is unconventional. Most experts, including Harry Boyle, recommend setting decoys at least two feet apart. At shooting time I was ready (for a change).

Shortly after shooting time a flock of ducks flew down the pond. I hit one which landed in the brush next to the hill. Daisy went out but came back without it. I went with her and she used her nose to find it in the tall grass. I didn't mind that it was a spoonie; this was Daisy's first good retrieve in several weeks. The wind calmed around 8:00 o'clock but resumed about half an hour later. I missed a number of shots of ducks that came in to the decoys. One particularly galling experience was to have three wing-set mallards right over the blind at 20 yards and miss three shots at them.

The morning was not the least boring. I did leave the blind and cut extra cover from the brush on the hill. Around 10:00 o'clock four mallards cruised down the pond. I turned them with the widgeon call and brought down a drake with a single shot. I should have tried for a double but I was so happy to hit one that I just watched it fall right next to the island. Daisy retrieved it to hand. All in all, it wasn't a bad morning, but if my shooting had been up to my decoy placement, it would have been brilliantly successful.

Bag: 1 mallard and 1 spoonie.

Other: Fred Ellers had an excellent shoot at Blind \#8. All morning birds kept flying off the holding pond right over his blind. He put about two dozen mixed sprig and mallard decoys by the east shore in the lee of the point. He felt this set was very effective.

Blind \#6 is continuing to shoot well.

There were 12 shooters at the club; everybody was fairly successful but there were only a few limits. Dean got three spoonies and a teal at \#5a.

Wednesday, December 4th: The Slump Continues

The winds died down and by Tuesday afternoon the weather reverted to that all too familiar light winds and haze. Daisy and I took an hour's walk along the east side road and saw hundreds of geese and quite a few ducks in the state ponds, but not too many ducks on or over the club.

Blind \#8 was taken when my turn came, so I selected \#9. I didn't go there last year and I was quite impressed with the island. Despite being new, it's not two muddy and offers excellent concealment with plenty of room for Daisy. The morning was clear with a light northeast wind. I followed Fred Ellers's suggestion and set two dozen mallard decoys along the east shore and two dozen sprig along the west shore. The ducks seemed to like this arrangement. I had a number of wing-set ducks over the pond. Most of them were too high but I fired anyway. I've been pressing too hard. Example, I had a mallard drake in range but missed four shots at him. I passed a number of chances at spoonies. Around 9:00 o'clock I fired three shots at a widgeon drake and brought it down in the pond about 90 yards north of the blind. Daisy made a very strong retrieve; she went right to the bird and brought it to hand. The action came to a dead stop around 10:00 o'clock. I waited another hour and then went in, disappointed at my poor shooting but pleased with Daisy's good retrieve. Bag: 1 widgeon.

Observation: On a clear day, \#9 is an enjoyable blind because the line of observation is away from the sun. Maybe next time with an easterly wind I'll put all the decoys along the east shore.

Other: Mike Ryan and his guest Darcy Swanson had an exciting day. Their boat went under and they got soaked on the way to \#6. However, they persevered and had a good shoot.

Fred Ellers' hot streak continues. He limited at \#5 with good ducks and observed a lot of birds over \#5A. On the other hand, Dean got only 2 spoonies at \#7. The extreme west blinds shot quite well.

Wednesday's breakfast, french toast and bacon, was excellent.

Wednesday, December 11th: More of the Same

John's wedding occupied my Saturday but, according to the game book, I didn't miss very much. However, on Sunday there was a north wind and everyone at the club did well.

Tuesday's weather was the usual, mild hazy and a light breeze from the southwest. Daisy and I walked along the outside road to the new clubhouse opposite Blind \#5. There were a fair number of ducks on the west side but nothing sensational.

I had last draw and went back to \#9. The morning was clear and hazy with a light wind from the southeast. I set most of he decoys on the east side and, after moving about 20 of them upwind of the island, felt I had a good spread. I missed two shots at two high widgeon and then resolved to let the birds work in. The only problem was the ducks circled my decoys a time or two and then settled in the house pond. Finally I saw a wing-set duck heading down the pond straight at me. I thought it had to be a spoonie but decided than Daisy needed the work. I let it get in close, then brought it down with one shot. I was pleasantly surprised when Daisy brought in not a spoonie but a big drake mallard. Once again, the morning was extremely slow. Bag: 1 mallard.

Other: Mike Ryan and his guest had a good shoot at \#3. Bill Armstrong doubled on mallards at \#1, his second mallard double this season.

Saturday, December 14th: A Friendly Fog

Fog usually stifles the shooting at Sprig Farm, but not so on Saturday. Friday afternoon was ominous, a sky so hazy that Mt. Diablo couldn't be seen from the clubhouse, a cold, clammy wind blowing from the east and radio reports of 1/8th mile visibility in the Valley. That afternoon Bill Armstrong commented that there were more ducks on the club than he'd seen in years and my observations while walking along the outer west side road seemed to confirm this. Daisy added excitement to the walk when she flushed a pheasant. At sunset the sky was completely overcast and Saturday's prospects looked grim. I was glad that I had packed a good book because it looked like I would spend Saturday morning reading in the clubhouse waiting for the fog to lift.

Surprisingly, the fog never settled to the ground; the corporation yard light (1 and 1/4 mile distant) remained visible all night. On Saturday morning ground level visibility was at least one mile, the ceiling was least 100 yards and the wind remained strong from the east. The stage was set for a an excellent shoot.

I went to Blind \#2 and saw more ducks in the air than any time this season, and more geese than I had ever seen at Sprig Farm. The action brought back memories of the early 80's. My only problem was that the birds over \#2 were too high to shoot. I called two flights of teal into the pond but they were gone before I could mount the gun. I also missed some shots at marginal range. The morning was a disappointment, but it wasn't boring. Some blinds, particularly \#5, \#7, \#9 and \#14, shot well. Blinds \#1 and \#6 didn't.

Bag: Skunked.

Other Friday's dinner, pork roast, scalloped potatoes and applesauce, was outstanding.

Wednesday, December 18th: "They all flew out."

A few showers were falling in advance of a weak storm front on Tuesday afternoon. I walked with Daisy along the west side road and saw many ducks on the nearby ponds. Things looked good for Wednesday morning. A little after sunset, I was feeding Daisy in my room while Bill Armstrong and Fred Ellers were chatting on the dock. About this time they saw flock after flock of birds get up and fly south. According to Bill, ducks leave the marsh for more sheltered areas when a storm is coming.

The front went through on Tuesday night leaving about 1/4 inch of rain. Wednesday morning the sky was cloudy and the wind was from the south. I went back to Blind \#9, set my decoys, and waited, and waited, and waited. It was the slowest morning of the season. Around 10 o'clock a lone bufflehead flew down the pond. I shot it so Daisy could get some work. The bird came down about 80 yards south of the island and began diving. Daisy stayed with it until she caught it and brought it to hand. Overall, Daisy had an excellent day. In addition to making the retrieve, she stayed down all morning and left the decoys alone.

Bag: 1 bufflehead.

Fred Ellers limited at \#5; he had only a few shooting opportunities but took advantage of them.

Saturday, December 21st: Back in the Groove

My last few hunts had been discouraging and I wasn't very optimistic on Friday afternoon. The weather was clear with a few high clouds. Mike Monteith and I took Cosby and Daisy for a long walk along the east side road. We saw a number of ducks on the state ponds, and several flocks of geese as well, but not very many birds on the club. Friday night was calm with a bright full moon; to put it mildly, the next day's prospects were not promising.

Saturday morning featured a thin high overcast with a 15 mph. wind from the east. I went to Blind \#7 and trampled down some of the heavy cover to improve visibility to the west. As I settled into the blind after setting the decoys, the ducks started flying, far more than I had expected. My first shot brought down a teal and a little later, I made a 40 yard overhead shot on a large sprig. For most of the morning there were ducks over my decoys, however, except for the spoonies, they were high. Most of the ducks came over my decoys wing-set and landed in the area between \#7 and \#8. Later on, I called in a flock of teal, shot one but missed the double. All my birds fell close to the blind and Daisy made routine retrieves to hand. My shooting was better than it had been several weeks and the number ducks in the air made my morning very enjoyable. Bag: 1 sprig and 2 teal.

Other: Mike Monteith had an excellent shoot at \#8, 1 sprig and 2 widgeon, but he missed several shots at mallards.

Fred Ellers took a "747" goose decoy to \#3. It looked funny on the middle seat of his boat, almost as though he had a partner but out at the blind it didn't help. Fred saw a lot of ducks going into the burned area at St. Germain.

Saturday, December 28th: Daisy's Best Retrieve

A bout with the flu kept me home on the 24th but by the weekend I was feeling better. Friday afternoon I drove to Sprig Farm in the rain for the first time in five years. I walked Daisy to the gate but didn't see much because of the rain.

The rain continued on and off through Friday night; about midnight I thought I saw the fog lowering on the river. However, on Saturday morning the rain stopped, although the wind continued to blow from the south and there were storm clouds in the south and west. I went to Blind \#8 and set most of my decoys around the island, with "wings" extending downwind from both sides of the island. Shortly after shooting time, I was blindsided several times and after that the action was fairly slow; apparently many ducks had left the marsh ahead of the storm. In any event the morning was beautiful; visibility was clear with a variety of clouds and rain falling on the hills to the north and west.

Around 8:30 I called in and shot a widgeon which went down about 200 yards southwest of the blind, about half way to \#9. Daisy and I went after it and when I reached the place where I thought it landed, Daisy became very excited and started tracking with her nose. She went about 100 yards further and disappeared into some tulles. I was delighted when she came back to me carrying the bird. This was her best retrieve ever. Later that morning I called in and shot a teal which fell close to the bind. Daisy made a routine retrieve. Finally, about 10:30, we lost a duck which dove on her and didn't come up. We hunted a wide area on the northeast side of the pond without success. In terms of Daisy's development, the morning was quite successful even though the bag, 1 widgeon and 1 teal, was mediocre.

Other: Friday's dinner was outstanding thanks to Al White (duck liver pate, barbecued mallard, special salad and dressing), Mike and Harri Monteith (smoked salmon mousse, wild and brown rice, seasoned french bread, fresh pineapple marinated in Contreau and shortbread cookies) and Paul Dali, who added to the festivities with a gourmet basket of crackers, cheeses and brownies. With dinner we drank a '70 Chateau Haut Bailly (a little thin but still very drinkable) and two California cabernets, an '85 B V private reserve cabernet (soft and full flavored -- an outstanding wine) and an '83 J.Lohr (very pleasant but not as impressive as the other two). All in all, it was a great evening.

Bill Armstrong prepared Saturday's breakfast, oatmeal and sweet rolls, because Joe was not felling well.

Dean brought Rusty Campbell as his guest. It was good to see Rusty but unfortunately, they were skunked at \#14. Bill Eppler was high gun at \#1.

On Saturday afternoon, Fish and Game set up a check point at the Montezuma Slough Bridge. The wardens took a quick look at my birds and license and wished me a happy new year. One final ironic item: I saw a pair of mallards flying over downtown Fairfield.

Tuesday, December 31st: A Double for Daisy

On Monday afternoon, I drove by way of \#680 and stopped at the Garibaldi tract to observe the ducks and geese. The numbers were only fair, not plentiful, leading me to suspect that the previous weekend's storm had driven many birds off the marsh. My afternoon walk seemed to confirm this, there were some sprig and mallard behind \#8 but most of the ducks I saw were spoonies. Daisy flushed two pheasants and chased three rabbits; I retrieved a red balloon from the tulles on the inner road behind \#8.

On Tuesday morning I was able to go back to \#8 thanks to Mike Ryan. The sky was partly cloudy with a 10-15 mph. wind from the east. I concentrated the decoys around the island with a long line of sprig extending down the pond towards \#7. At shooting time the sky was empty, not a good sign, but the ducks started flying about fifteen minutes later. There was a spectacular flight of ducks off the north shore and over the island, but they were too high to shoot. I missed a sprig trying to land in the decoys and spent the next two hours looking at occasional ducks that come into view. A number of ducks landed in the pond about half way to \#7. The action was very slow. Around 9 o'clock I brought down a sprig with a 40 yard overhead shot. Ten minutes later I called in and shot a teal. Towards 10 o'clock a pair of widgeon landed in the middle of the pond and, surprisingly, swam toward my decoys. They were about 50 yards downwind when they got up and flew toward the island. I got the hen with the first shot, missed the drake with my second shot and brought it down with my third. Daisy made the double retrieve. It was an otherwise routine morning for her because the other two ducks fell close to the blind. Bag: 1 sprig, 1 teal and 2 widgeon.

Other: Mike Monteith doubled on mallards at \#7. His drake was the largest one I have ever seen; it must have weighed 4 pounds. Cosby made blind retrieves on a sprig and a gadwall for Alan and Mitch White, who were shooting at \#14.

On New Years Eve the members who were staying over were having a dinner of clam chowder and cracked crab.

Mike Ryan started the New Year right! He was high gun at \#8 with two mallards and two teal. The four other shooters got one sprig each. According to the shooters, the day was very slow.

Saturday, January 4th: Finale

Rain was forecast for Friday night but a high fog encased the marsh that afternoon and a cold wind blew from the east. I helped Dean pump out \#2 and \#6 and we saw large numbers of big ducks get up from those ponds. Later, while walking Daisy along the west side levee road, I saw many sprig and widgeon on the shore opposite \#8 and \#7, and in the pond at \#5A. It rained about .10 inch on Friday night.

Saturday morning was still foggy but the ceiling was over 100 yards, with the wind from the southeast at 10-15 mph. I drew third pick and went back to \#8. I set the decoys as on Tuesday last. At shooting time only a few ducks were flying and these were very high. I shot a teal and a spoonie that came into the decoys, missed three good opportunities on teal, and wasted almost a box a shells shooting at ducks at marginal range. My shooting was undistinguished, to put it mildly. Bag: 1 teal and 1 spoonie.

Other: We had a full house on Friday night; everybody enjoyed the steak dinner and Muriel's plum pudding.

Fred Ellers had last pick, went to \#2 and was high gun with 2 mallards, a sprig and a teal. Mike Monteith got skunked at \#7.

Daisy went with Cosby to help Alan White find a bird in the tulles east of \#1. However, they were unsuccessful.

Reflections: Although the words "slow" and "skunked" appear too many times throughout these pages, I can't bring myself to call this past season a bad one. To put matters in perspective, I recall several even slower mornings in the 1988-89 season when I saw only one or two ducks which were far out of range.

This past season was basically enjoyable and in several respects unusual. First, we didn't have a single day of that pea soup fog that makes shooting impossible. Second, the weather pattern in the late season gives hopes that the drought may be ending. Third, this year we saw more Bay ducks, i.e., buffleheads, bluebills, etc. than in past years. Fourth, attendance at the club was the best in years and wine consumption (five cases) set a new record. Essentially, our members kept coming back because they enjoyed the marsh setting and the club's atmosphere even on days when the shooting was poor.

I am disappointed that Daisy did not have more ducks to retrieve. However, this is partly because I was selective in what I shot at (4 spoonies this year as contrasted with 7 in 1990-91 and 5 in 1989-90) and also, because there were days when I did not shoot well. Daisy's blind behavior improved. She now stays down a matter of course but she will does retrieve a decoy if I don't watch her. She made one outstanding nose retrieve but has not reached Cosby's level. I looking forward to the day when she can find ducks for other hunters.

Season's Total -- 26, consisting of 4 mallard, 3 sprig, 7 teal, 7 widgeon, 4 spoonies and 1 bufflehead.
