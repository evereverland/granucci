Saturday, October 17th: Preview of Coming Attractions.

Last Saturday of the off-season -- only seven more days! Muriel and I brought up my motor and other gear and, after completing the process of moving in, we enjoyed a glorious day on the marsh. A rain storm had just blown through followed by a fresh wind and a sky full of impressive thunderclouds. There were ducks all over the club. We took a short boat ride; at \#9 we saw a dozen brown pelicans skimming over the water and at \#8 enough ducks to make me homesick for my favorite blind. A little before sunset we walked out the inner east side road for a mile or so. There were many mallards resting in the area around \#14 and more flying in. I was very optimistic about the prospects for opening day.

Saturday, October 24th: "Duck Hunting at its Best"[^1]

Unfortunately, the weather deteriorated during the week; Friday, the 23rd, was extremely warm. Dean, Mike Monteith, Allan White, Peter Svendsen, Bob Boydat and I shot sporting clays at Birds Landing. Dean and Mike M. had gun problems. I finished the afternoon a little wilted from the 90 degree heat but satisfied with my score.

There was one hundred percent attendance for Friday's steak barbecue, the repast complimented by two traditional favorites, Harri Monteith's salmon mousse and apple strudel. The evening's conviviality seemed even more high-spirited than usual. Bob Boydat slept downstairs in the sitting room because all the beds were occupied; he was serenaded all night by ducks calling.

I drew a low number but Dean invited me to join him at \#2. As the morning worked out Dean did all the shooting and I did the dog handling. As a team we got six ducks. I've never had a more enjoyable opening day even though I didn't shoot a single duck. Daisy's outstanding work more than satisfied me. She made six retrieves; none could be called routine and four were outstanding. Her easiest retrieve was a two hundred yard fetch of a diving mallard. She found three crippled mallards that had burrowed into thick matted grass. Her last find was accomplished after lunch when I took her back to the pond. Dean was suitably impressed; he said that without Daisy we might not have found a single duck.

Most of our shooters had limits or near limits, consisting mainly of mallards.

Other: Jim Jacobsen and Peter Svendsen brought some excellent wine for dinner. This year's club wines are 1991 Trader Joes' President Select Cabernet, Storey Vinyards Zinfandel, 1992 Hacienda Chardonnay and Vega Chardonnay.

Our two owls began hooting at 3:00 a.m.

Bill Armstrong said the mice are under control.

Wednesday, October 27th: The heat's on.

Santa Ana winds brought heat and high fire danger to Southern California while on the marsh, Tuesday afternoon's temperature was 90 degrees. Around 5:00 p.m., Mike Monteith and I tried to take a walk on the east side road. We'd ventured only a hundred yards or so beyond the gate when the wind died down and the mosquitoes chased us back to the clubhouse. I watched the sunset from the bridge and saw several pairs of mallards in \#10 pond.

Tuesday's dinner featured perfectly cooked London Broil accented by Mike Ryan's teryiaki ginger sauce.

On Wednesday morning I went to \#8 and spread my decoys in clusters around the north and east sides of the pond. Though hot weather was forecast, the morning turned out to be pleasantly mild, with a clear sky and a 10-15 mph breeze from the north to east quadrants. I was ready at shooting time and a few minutes later the ducks started flying. In the first two hours there were many birds in air. I shot one mallard that fell close to the blind and three other ducks on which Daisy made long-distance retrieves. I had to help her with two of them. I don't like to carry a gun when I'm wading in \#8 pond and Daisy justified my confidence. One widgeon came down in the north side grass and, as Daisy approached, got up and flew another 100 yards. Daisy chased it down.

Most other shooters did well.

Other: Dean's guest Steve got a wood duck, the first shot at Sprig Farm in recent years.

I drove home on Wednesday afternoon in 80 degree heat; the warm weather was forecast to continue.

One shooter commented at lunchtime that he thought there were more ducks than on opening day. Mike Ryan got two mallards and a sprig at \#2.

At 3:00 a.m. I heard the owl hooting and a coyote howling.

Bag: 1 mallard, 1 teal, 2 widgeon.

Saturday, October 30th: The skunk is no treat.

The scene: Friday, Halloween eve, a jack-o-lantern perched on the gramophone glows with the outline of a flying duck.[^2] Enter Al While wearing a fright mask. Someone says, "Keep it on, you've never looked better." During cocktail hour, the odor of a skunk wafts through the sitting room, an ominous omen for the morrow.

[^2]: The artist was Harri Monteith.

At dinner Mike Ryan treated us to a peanut-curry sauce which went very well with Joe's baked pork chops.

Friday afternoon had been hot and so hazy that I could barely see the outline of Mt. Diablo from the clubhouse. Daisy and I took a long walk along the west side road and observed quite a few ducks on \#7 and \#8 ponds. When Dean and his guest drove out to cut brush, about 100 ducks flew up, circled around and settled back on the club property.

There's little to say about the next morning's shooting. The moon was full and bright, with only the faintest hint of a breeze. I had last draw, went to blind \#1 and didn't fire a shot. I saw very few ducks flying; two flocks of teal sped over at extreme range and I let them pass. I left the blind around 10:30 and visited Bill Armstrong in \#5A where Daisy and I hunted for a downed mallard. Daisy worked very hard but to no avail. Bill thought the duck had dived and stayed down. Dean and his guest had good shooting at \#2; they brought in three ducks and said they should have gotten more. Mike Monteith bagged a gadwall and a widgeon at \#8. Some mallards were taken on the east side.

In sum, although some other members were successful, my morning is best described as uneventful.

Bag: Skunked.

Wednesday, November 3rd: A little more like Fall.

Tuesday afternoon's weather remained warm and languid but the sky was a little clearer. The mosquitoes were so numerous and aggressive that we shortened our afternoon walk. At twilight a few ducks were flying over our ponds. When Dean went out to cut brush, at least 50 flared up from the area behind \#7.

My fourth choice put me at \#2 and, as my boat beached on the island, two mallards flew off. The morning felt fresh and clear, hinting of a change from the hot weather we'd endured since opening day. The pond was scenic and the hawks and seagulls flying close to the blind told me that concealment on the island was excellent. I missed my first shot at a high mallard. Around 8:00 o'clock three mallards came over from the south. I hit a hen which dropped in the pond and swam into the grass to the right of the ditch to Noyes Slough. Daisy followed it and entered the grass at the same spot. She hunted for it for about ten minutes and then I went over to help. We spent almost half an hour searching the whole area without success. Later, I saw a hawk glide over the area without any reaction. At the end of the morning, Daisy and I took the boat and searched the entire northwest quadrant of the pond. It is duck hunter lore that wounded mallards will dive and hold onto something to stay down.

Others had mixed results. Mike Monteith got a mallard and a sprig at \#8; Dean struck out at \#7. Mike Ryan got two mallards at \#5A and Allan White got two mallards at \#14. Bob Boydat and his brother were skunked at \#3 while Tom Lucas got three ducks at \#1.

Other: Mike Ryan, normally a gentleman of taste and refinement, walked in the club room wearing something even more hideous than Al White' fright mask -- a Raiders cap!

Bag: Skunked.

Saturday, November 6th: Mash hospitality.

My anticipation started to build on Thursday morning when Bill called to say that we'd been invited to the marsh party at the Wheeler Island Club.[^3] Friday afternoon was a little cooler (low 80's) but the mosquitoes were as nasty as ever. Daisy and I saw hardly any ducks on the state property when we walked along the east side.

[^3]: Wheeler's official name is "The Black Mallard Gun Club."

The evening's enjoyment began with a ride in Bill Armstrong's new 15 hp. boat. Noyes Slough was as smooth as a billiard table and we "flew" to St Germain in close to record time. We then jumped in the back of St. Germain's pickup truck and were treated to a scenic ride on the 3/4 mile levee road to Wheeler Island. Ordinarily I would have preferred to walk along the river, but the mosquitoes were so aggressive that everyone appreciated the ride. The consensus of shooters throughout the marsh is that this is the worst mosquito year in recent history.

Wheeler Island's hospitality was superb. We were greeted at the door with our choice of cocktails as we filled out name tags. Next we were ushered into the main room, its table full of pre dinner appetizers consisting of raw vegetables with dip, prawns with cocktail sauce, chips, etc. Then we enjoyed shrimp salad, raviolis. turkey, ham and roast beef. The raviolis were so good that I had a second helping. Desert was a chocolate cake decorated with a marsh scene. We met shooters from the surrounding clubs and the atmosphere was festive and convivial. Bill and I sped back to Sprig Farm around nine o'clock; Dean and the others stopped at St. Germain for a nightcap and came back a little later.

I had first choice and went to \#8. The air was still when I set my decoys but shortly after sunrise a fresh 10 mph wind came up from the north. There weren't many ducks flying but there the morning were enlivened by literally hundreds of swallows and meadowlarks filling the sky around my island with their aerobatics. They suddenly disappeared around 9:30. Also, several large flocks of white terns flew up and down the pond.

I fired a few shots at ducks at extreme range but made the most of my only real shooting opportunity and brought down a large mallard drake which fell about 50 yards out in the pond. Daisy made a routine retrieve.

I also learned a lesson. About 8:45 I heard a shrill "peep" behind me. I asked myself who was using a teal call. The answer came almost immediately when about ten teal "buzzed" my island and raced up the pond to \#7. What should I have done? If I had turned around to look when I heard the teal I would have been off balance and unable to shoot. Instead, I should have immediately grabbed my whistle and started calling. This might have turned the flock and brought them back into shooting range.

On the way back to the clubhouse I stopped at \#9 where Daisy tried to find a spoonie for Dean. We searched the grassy area between the ditch and the house pond but were unsuccessful.

Other: There was something "fishy" about the club on Friday afternoon. Joe was making chowder with a fish head Al White had given him.

Other shooters had mixed results. Peter Svendsen got a pair of mallards at \#3.

Bag: 1 mallard.

Wednesday, November 10th: A change for the better.

Tuesday afternoon featured a high thin overcast, temperature in the 60's and a brisk wind from the south. Rain was predicted for Wednesday. I drove up on \#680, stopped by the Garibaldi reserve for lunch but saw only a few ducks in the distance, and no geese. At the club gate, I was surprised and delighted when Fred Ellers pulled up behind me; he was Dean's guest. Fred and I took a boat ride and he shot some videotape of the marsh landscape. Later, Daisy and I enjoyed a walk along the west side road where she chased a cottontail and a jackrabbit and we saw a number of ducks flying over our ponds. The cloudy sky made for a dramatic sunset and better yet, the mosquitoes had beaten a temporary retreat.

I had a fairly good blind draw and went to \#8. By morning the sky had lowered and a storm front was approaching from the west. However, there hardly any wind, only a gentle breeze from the east that barely rippled the water. I'd expected a wind from the south and used a different decoy placement: twenty mallard decoys in the grass east of the blind, the remaining four next to the island, sprig decoys in "wings" or a rough "V" shape extending out downwind from the island. This drew a number of ducks near the island, but they stayed just out of shooting range. The dull grey sky probably helped my concealment.

The action was sporadic. About 7:30 a widgeon crossed the pond about 30 yards to the west. Using the swing-through method I brought it down with one shot. Daisy made a routine 50-yard retrieve. During the morning several large flocks worked the pond and one flock responded to my teal call (I thought they were flying like teal). After several passes, they headed directly toward the blind over the gap in my decoys. I picked out a target, fired, and brought down two widgeon hens which fell near the decoys. Daisy swam to the first duck and mouthed it. Then she swam to the second and tried to take it at the same time. She quickly realized this was impossible so she brought me the first duck in and then went back for the second one.

Otherwise, the morning was very quiet. There were fewer swallows and terns then on the previous Saturday. About 10:15 I called in a spoonie and shot it at about 25 yards as it was going away (something like a high two shot in skeet). Another routine retrieve for Daisy. Then I picked up and went in.

Other: Dean and Fred went to \#2 where Dean got a Scotch double on mallards. Mike Monteith said he fired a lot of ammunition at \#7 but only got one duck, a large drake mallard.

Late in the morning, a small helicopter hovered low over \#2 and \#3 ponds. Dean thought it was trying to land. On Thursday I called Frank Fiala and asked whether any of St. Germain's members had seen it. Frank had also seen it as he was heading down Noyes Slough to his clubhouse. During the past summer Frank had complained about students at a Concord-based helicopter school using their property for practice landings. He mentioned that St. Germain had only five shooters on Wednesday.

Tuesday's dinner featured a nicely done Chateubriand.

Mike Ryan's car stalled at the main gate on Tuesday afternoon. At noon on Wednesday I drove him and Honey to the ranger station to meet the tow truck.

Bag: 3 widgeon and 1 spoonie.

Saturday, November 13th: End of the first half.

Friday afternoon's temperature stayed in mid 60's and the sky was clear. There was a fresh wind from the west but the mosquitoes were so bad that we turned back at the bushes opposite \#7. There were a number of ducks on the dirt mound behind that pond. I especially enjoyed our after-dinner walk in the cold clear evening air, with the lights from the surrounding towns sparkling like a necklace of diamonds.

A small craft advisory of north winds had been posted for Suisun Bay and the Delta but at shooting time, \#8 pond was dead calm and nothing was flying. A few minutes later a lone teal flew around the island. I missed three shots, called it back as I reloaded and then missed another two shots. What a horrid start! Around 7:30 the wind started blowing and a little later, a sprig and a pair of widgeon flew in outside the decoys and landed in the north side of the pond. Something caused the trio to flare, the sprig came over the blind and I brought it down with one shot. Daisy made a routine 40 yard "one cookie" retrieve. Some time later, I called in and a flock of teal which came over at 40+ yards. I missed them.

Nothing happened after 9:00 a.m. I picked up a hour later and took a long boat ride around the west side of the club. I stopped at \#2 and tried to find three downed birds for Clay Judd and Jim Jacobsen. Clay's own dog Rex, an excellent Golden Retriever, had no luck trying to find them so I can't really fault Daisy for her lack of success.

Mike Monteith bagged a widgeon at \#7, Al White got 2 mallards at \#14 and Peter Svendsen was skunked at \#3.

Using the field glasses I saw two hot air balloons in the distance; they were probably over Napa.

Bag: 1 sprig.

Other: Mike Ryan drove home with two beef roasts from the freezer.

Reflection: This relatively uneventful morning ended a first half that had seen more birds on our marsh than in previous years, and far more mosquitoes. The hot weather certainly put a damper on our first five hunts. I've been firing much less ammunition but my take to this point is close to normal.

Intermission

A gridiron tragedy (Stanford 17 - Cal 46) followed by a triumph (49'ers 42 - Saints 7) helped ease my duck withdrawal pangs. The weather turned cold at Thanksgiving time and 1.50 inches of rain fell over that weekend. I shot trap with Dean later that week and was pleased to hear that the mosquitoes had gone and the club was full of sprig. Daisy and Cosby went pheasant hunting at Black Point. Daisy pointed a pheasant and Cosby honored the point.

Saturday December 11th: The thrill is back.

Take the pleasure of returning to Sprig Farm after the mid season break, add a Pacific storm and a sumptuous dinner, then subtract the mosquitoes and you have the formula for a very enjoyable shoot. The roasts were back, the centerpiece of a German "fest" hosted by Mike Ryan. It commenced with a beer tasting, followed by sauerbraten, potato pancakes with sour cream and applesauce, red cabbage and noodles, all home made. I stayed with the beer during dinner; others switched to wine.

Friday afternoon's fresh 64 degrees and cloud-filled sky heralded an approaching storm; a small craft advisory was posted for Suisun Bay. Daisy and I enjoyed a mosquito-free walk along the west side where we saw a fair number of ducks.

The wind howled throughout the night but the rain held off until just before shooting time, as I climbed into the barrel at \#10. Then it poured. I've never experienced a heavier rain on the marsh. My rain gauge at home recorded 0.96 inches in three hours. When the rain eased (it didn't stop until 10 o'clock), the ducks started flying. Blind 10 has a new dirt island which makes it dog-friendly. It was hard to see in the rain but for the first hour and a half there were plenty of ducks in the air and at least something flying nearly all morning. A strong wind blew out of the east; later it shifted to south.

My first shot felled a widgeon which came down 80 yards toward the barn. It was a diver but Daisy stayed with it. My second shot hit a teal which landed in the grass between blind \#10 and the entrance to old \#11. Daisy found it quickly. After a few misses I filled out my limit with two more teal, each of which fell close to the blind and were routine retrieves. There were swarms of spoonies all morning. Others commented that the spoonies were almost as thick as the mosquitoes had been during the first half of the season.

Everyone came in tired and hungry; we greatly enjoyed Joe's spaghetti lunch.

bag: one widgeon and three teal.

Other: At \#8, Don Broemsle tripled on spoonies and shot another one to fill out his limit.

Midweek, December 15th -- 16th: Butte Sink excursion.

A Court of Appeals opinion states: "The Butte Sink area is one of the prime waterfowl areas in the state . . . ." (Butte Creek Island Ranch v. Crim (1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 360, 361.) I experienced this at first hand, thanks to Peter Flood's invitation to shoot at the North Butte County Club, located a short distance from the renowned Wild Goose Club.

The North Butte members gave me a warm and friendly welcome; the food and amenities were everything one would expect at a first-rate duck club. The scenery was spectacular. Shooting in the midst of flooded oak trees was a never to be forgotten experience.

I thought Wednesday morning's shoot, which the members called mediocre, was spectacular; I've never seen more ducks flying although most of them were widgeon and gadwall. Thursday morning was foggy until noon with maximum visibility of 300 yards. The members described the shooting as poor; I didn't think it was particularly bad. Regrettably, my shooting was not up to the surroundings. I couldn't hit any mallards but did get three gadwall and a widgeon on Wednesday and two more gadwall on Thursday. On Wednesday afternoon I took an interesting walk and saw hundreds of Sand Hill cranes in a nearby field. I also put up around 20 pheasants at the corner where the club road meets the highway. My Butte Sink experience will rank among my lifetime great hunting memories.

Saturday, December 18th: Back on the home field.

Friday afternoon was cool and brisk with the temperature hovering at 50 degrees; it felt like there would be fog the next morning. I saw only a few ducks on our walk along the west side road. Al White saw many ducks at sunset as he was driving in.

Later, Al kept a careful watch on some ten or so mallards on the club's new Weber grill. They arrived on the table "done to a turn." The consensus was that we'd never tasted better duck. I brought up some older cabernets which went well with the meal.

Saturday morning dawned clear and brisk with a fresh 15 mph wind from the north east. The scenery was beautiful; the marsh showed its winter's best. I went back to \#8 and found my favorite pond almost spoonie-free (Don B. had chased them away). I made good shots at widgeon and teal, but lost another teal in the north side grass. I also missed several opportunities for teal because I didn't react quickly enough.

Bag: one widgeon and one teal.

Other: Mike Ryan's guest, thirteen year-old C.J. Estrada, enjoyed his first duck hunt. He shot a mallard and a widgeon, at \#3.

Wednesday, December 22nd: First day of winter.

Tuesday afternoon's temperature was 40 degrees, the sky hazy with a foggy overcast; ground level visibility was no more than 3 miles. Daisy and I took a long walk in the bone-chilling wind and saw many ducks settled on our east side ponds.

I awoke several times on Tuesday night, looked out my window and was reassured to see the lights of Pittsburg and Antioch. In other words, the fog didn't lower. The morning's temperature was 38 degrees and a strong wind, still blowing from the east, kept the fog above ground level. Nevertheless, the sky was darker than usual. I had my decoys set and was ready in \#8 blind at shooting time. I tried a different decoy placement. Instead of spreading ducks all around the north and east shores in my end of the pond, I set a few mallards around the island, placed the sprig in two lines like a "V" extending out downwind from the blind, and put most of the mallard decoys in the grass immediately to the east and upwind of the island. This seems to be a good fogy day spread.

A few minutes after 7:00, a flock appeared overhead. I fired a shot and hit a bird which dove, then leveled out and landed in the grass about 200 yards between \#8 and \#9. I went with Daisy and searched the area. After coursing back and forth several times Daisy pointed at a spot in the thick matted grass. On my command she dug into the grass and brought out -- a coot! That's the reward for shooting in the dim light.

During the morning I missed some shots but hit 2 teal and 2 widgeon. Daisy worked hard to retrieve one of the widgeon, a diver; the other three were routine retrieves. I passed up shots at spoonies that came to my decoys and also passed up a shot at a large duck that was 30 yards overhead because I couldn't identify it. I went in at 10:30.

bag: one widgeon and one teal

Other: Al White came in from \#15 at 1:00 p.m. with three mallards on his strap. Bob Boydat and his brother didn't do very well at \#14. Craig Young and his guest got a few birds at \#2, including a goldeneye. Dean shot one sprig and two spoonies at \#7.

Joe served Swiss Steak, a favorite of mine, for Tuesday's dinner.

Driving home on Wednesday afternoon I saw the tulle elk for the first time this season; they were 300 yards north of the road between the gas well and the mallard ponds.

Friday, December 24th: T'was the day before Christmas.

And it was cold -- even colder than Wednesday. Thursday afternoon's sky was hazy with very thin high clouds and a hard wind out of the east; it felt much colder than the indicated 43 degrees. Rascal joined us on a walk out the west side road. We saw sprig on some of the ponds and heard mallards calling. Daisy put up a rooster pheasant. When we were parallel to \#7, I turned back because it was so cold.

Mike, Monteith, Peter Svendsen, Jim Jacobsen and I enjoyed a rock cornish game hen dinner; Al and Mitch White arrived later that evening. In the morning, the horizontal visibility had closed to 400 yards, the temperature was 33 degrees and a hard wind out of the northeast brought a wind chill factor I don't even want to think about. Mike and I were in \#7 and \#8. I set my decoys as on Wednesday. I started out badly by failing to recognize a sprig in the dim light. I thought it was just another spoonie until it was too late.

The action was just as cold as the morning but there was one comical moment. Mike fired a shot and caused some ducks on the north side of the pond to flare. A flock of widgeon came over; I fired an overhead shot and brought down a drake which hit me on the head and fell to the bottom of the barrel. Daisy didn't know what to do; she sniffed around and waded out into the pond. I threw the dead duck into the water so that she could go through the motions of making a retrieve. Shortly before ten I shot a spoonie which fell about 50 yards toward the entrance from the channel to the blind and dove several times as Daisy chased it. Daisy caught it after the third dive and brought it in. Thus ended a cold, dreary and very slow morning.

Bag: One widgeon and one spoonie.

Other: Mike Monteith was high gun at \#7 with one sprig and one mallard. Al and Mitch got only one sprig at \#14 but they were staying over until Sunday. Al quipped, "The bad news is that we were fogged in. The good news is that we get to hunt like this for three whole days."

Wednesday, December 29th: Daisy's narrow escape.

Wednesday's shoot was the slowest of the season but we had some excitement from another source.

Tuesday afternoon's weather was the most pleasant in recent weeks, temperature in the mid 50's, partly cloudy sky and light winds. Daisy and I took a boat ride with Dean out to \#1 to cut some brush because the club Jeep wasn't running; we took another ride on our own down Noyes Slough where we saw sprig settled on St. Germain's ponds but didn't disturb them. Later we took an hour's walk on the east side road and saw more ducks than I'd seen all season resting on the state ponds. We'd gone out a mile or more when Daisy's hackles went up and she uttered a ferocious growl. Then, still growling, she slowly advanced on a clump of tulles by the road. I wondered what might be in there until I saw a broad black and white striped tail being raised. I called out, "No Daisy," "Back," and finally, "Heel!" Luckily enough, she did. Disaster averted.

Tuesday night was clear, the moon bright and full. The fog settled in around 4:00 a.m., lifted around sunrise and returned with a vengeance at around 10 o'clock. Wednesday morning's temperature was 48 degrees. Very light winds blew sporadically out of the north and east quadrants. I went to \#10 and was settling into the blind when a sprig came overhead at 50 yards. I would have tried a shot had I been ready. Many ducks were sitting around the pond (well out of range, of course) and they stayed there all morning. There were virtually no ducks in the sky except the occasional spoonies which came in to my decoys. I heard a lot of firing on the state lands. Around 9:30 a spoonie coasted down the pond about 40 yards out. I brought it down with one shot. Fifteen minutes later I called in a flock of teal which came overhead at 20 yards. I hit my first shot and watched the duck fall. Instead, I should have dismounted the gun, pivoted, and shot at the other teal as they were flying away. This have been like a high station one skeet shot.

A little before 10:00 o'clock I picked up my decoys and went to meet Jim Graziani and his quest at the entrance to St. Germain's \#28 pond. They hadn't fired a shot. By this time, the fog was so thick I could barely see the clubhouse from the junction of the canals.

Bag: one teal and one spoonie.

Other: Dean at \#1, Tom Lucas at \#5A and Jim Jacobsen at \#14 got skunked. Mike Monteith got a teal at \#8 and Alan and Mitch White had a good shoot at \#3. Surprisingly, Mike Ryan and his guest limited on big ducks at \#2.

Out at \#7, Bob Boydat saw a coyote in the bushes about 150 yards toward the road.

During the morning I saw a white unmarked Suburban on the east side road; at lunchtime Al White said it was an undercover Fish & Game vehicle.

Wednesday, January 5th: A little improvement.

A light rain was falling during Tuesday afternoon's drive to the club. I saw many big ducks between the main gate and the clubhouse. Daisy and I took the boat out to \#1 to help Dean cut brush. The water level in our ponds is still low. Then because of the rain, we took a nap instead of our regular walk.

The rain stopped after dinner; Craig Young and I walked out to the gate and back.

During the night the sky cleared and the waning moon shone through my window. As I was navigating out to blind \#7 (Dean had picked \#8) a gentle wind came out of the north and the moon continued shining through a light surface fog which was forming. At shooting time the visibility was 400 yards. The fog lifted before 8:00 and, although the sky remained overcast, I had a clear view of the clubhouse from \#7 and could even see the trees at Rich Island, a least one airline mile away.

Using my new Beretta 390 for the first time, I started out by missing shots at a teal and a pair of high widgeon. After this poor start, I decided to forget the gun and concentrate on the ducks. I brought down a teal and a sprig, each with one shot. Both fell dead and were routine retrieves for Daisy. Later, I missed a couple of shots at high birds. The fog lowered at 9:45, cutting visibility to 200 yards. About this time four ducks came racing out of the fog. Thinking they were teal, I mounted the gun, fired once and brought one down. It turned out to be a bufflehead.

Overall, the first two hours of Wednesday were the most enjoyable I've spent in recent weeks. The weather wasn't too cold and there were some ducks in the air.

Bag: one sprig, one teal, one bufflehead

Other: Dean limited at \#8. The rest of our shooters had a fairly slow morning.

The owls are back. I heard them hooting before dinner and Clay Judd heard them during the night.

Alan and Mitch White spent the New Year's weekend at the club. They limited on mallards on each of the three days for a total of 18.

Jim Graziani doubled on spoonies at St. Germain's

blind \#7. He and his guest filled out their limits with sprig, mallards and teal.

Saturday, January 8th: Weather woes.

The same dreary weather pattern -- dry windless days with heavy fog -- continued to plague the season's second half. Friday afternoon's walk, in hazy sunshine, temperature in the low 50's and a light wind from the east, was the most enjoyable part of this shoot. Daisy and I stayed out for two hours and walked at least two miles out the east side road. We saw many ducks resting on the state ponds. As we approached, they would get up and fly a hundred yards or so to the next pond; they obviously liked the area and weren't anxious to leave.

Rascal came with us and gave me some anxious moments. At our farthest point from the club, we saw a party of men and dogs from Wheeler Island walking on their side of the Roaring River. Here, the river is 80 yards wide. Rascal swam over and joined them. He ignored my calls to come back for a while, then changed his mind and swam back.

Saturday morning was a disappointment. I navigated to \#8 and set my decoys in clear weather. Just after shooting time a flight of sprig came over the island but I let them pass because they were a little out of range. A few minutes later the fog formed and reduced visibility to 100 yards. It persisted until 9:00, then began to lift as I was resetting my decoys. Meanwhile, the sky clouded over and it began to rain on and off for an hour or so. There was almost nothing flying. At 10:30 I saw a small duck flying toward me. I brought it down with one shot and Daisy made a 40-yard retrieve in open water. It turned out to be a bufflehead. I left the blind at 10:50.

Bag: one bufflehead.

Other: Dean and his guest got a mallard and two lesser ducks at \#3. Tom Lucas got skunked.

Alan and Mitch White also did poorly -- for them that is -- they "only" got four mallards at \#15.

Wednesday, January 12th: Weather woes worsen.

Tuesday afternoon was as usual, hazy sunshine, light wind and temperature in the high 50's. There were plenty of spoonies in the ponds along the Grizzly Island Road. We walked out the west side road to the boundary gate opposite \#5 and observed many ducks of all kinds on the state ponds as well as our ponds. At a point parallel to \#7 pond, Daisy and Rascal started barking. I looked up and saw two raccoons on top of the nearest telephone pole. Apparently they heard us coming and got out of the way. As we continued on, one raccoon stayed up on the pole, the other disappeared. On the way back I kept Daisy beside me to avoid an encounter.

The dreary weather that plagued the second half of the season continued; the night stayed clear, but a thick fog formed just at shooting time. I took Dean's guest, Bob Silverstein, to \#2. He is an enthusiastic new shooter. While I generally prefer shooting a single blind, Bob's company in the blind made the miserable shooting conditions somewhat more bearable. His duck hunting knowledge and recognition ability were remarkable for a first year shooter. He downed two teal with two shots. One fell in the water and was a routine retrieve, the other fell in the grass behind the blind. Bob went out with Daisy and he was surprised when she pointed the duck and then caught it when he said "get the bird."

I had a lucky shot on a mallard that came over the blind just after shooting time. My gun was empty but I loaded a shell and took the bird going away while saying to myself, "Skeet, high one."

The fog was the worst yet, 100 hundred yards visibility. At quarter to nine the sun began to break through and we thought it would clear. Then the fog thickened and stayed all morning.

Other: There's very little to report; shooting was poor all over the club.

bag: one mallard.

Saturday, January 15: Curtain coming down.

Friday afternoon's weather on the marsh was the bleakest I've ever known. The haze was so thick that visibility was less than a mile, the temperature was in the low 50's and a wind out of the east made it feel at least 10 degrees colder.

I closed out the season with a flurry of boating activity. Wynn Oliver had arranged to take his boat out from Sprig Farm. I met him at the gate and Daisy and I took him down to St. Germain. Wynn gave me a tour and I had a nice visit with Frank Fiala while Daisy ran with some of that club's dogs. The trip each way took 25 minutes. I set the throttle on my 4 hp. motor where it sounded as though it was running most economically and, with one filling of the motor's internal tank, made it to St. Germain and back to the "Y" where the channels lead off to the east and west sides. When we got back to the dock, we met Dean and went out to \#1 to help him cut brush.

Just before sunset, Daisy and Rascal and I walked out the west side road to the new clubhouse opposite \#5A. We saw plenty of ducks on both sides of the road.

Jeff Smith prepared Friday's dinner; our final meal was a great one, filet mignon, the best scalloped potatoes I've ever tasted, a saute of zucchini, onions and mushrooms, roasted garlic, a marvelous walnut and gorgonzola salad, followed by Muriel's plum pudding, which I flamed with a pint of brandy.

The fog returned overnight, so thick I couldn't see beyond the other side of the canal. After breakfast I went to \#8 and set my decoys. Visibility was less than 100 yards; the north side shore was barely visible and even my farthest decoys were fading from sight. By 8:45 I knew the fog wasn't about to lift so Daisy and I came in and rested in our room.

Around 10:15 the sky started to brighten. so I went back out and reached \#8 pond just as the fog lifted. We stayed out until lunch time. A few birds came over my decoys high and I "saluted" them. Actually, this is a silly thing to do because it wastes shells and could spoil the shooting for others.

I called in a teal and brought it down. It bounced once on the water and swam to the shore opposite the road. Daisy set out at an angle to the right, went far into the grass, turned to her left and found the bird quite a distance into the cover. This was an excellent retrieve, a fine finishing note for her season.

Another flight of teal took me by surprise. I missed them because I didn't set my feet and mount the gun properly. Moral: When teal surprise you, grab your teal call instead of the gun, call them back and then be ready to shoot.

After lunch I took a third and final trip to \#8 pond and picked up my decoys while listening to the 49'er game. The afternoon, warm and languid, seemed more like September than January. Later, after my gear was packed, I stretched out for a nap but was rudely awakened when a yellowjacket stung me just below my eye. I knew it was time to go home.

Other: Mike Ryan drew a low blind number; I recommended that he go to \#10 and he had a good shoot there.

As I drove out of the marsh in the fading afternoon light, the thought that duck season was ended gave me a feeling of satisfaction and contentment. True enough, the season's miserable weather, heat and mosquitoes the first half, fog the second, had badly hurt the shooting. And yet, even at less that its best, marsh is an enjoyable place, particularly when shared with good companions. Each one of my Sprig Farm outings had given me something to enjoy, even if that "something" didn't always happen during the morning shoot. Daisy also seemed contented. I think she was looking forward to some pheasant hunting.

Bag: one teal.

Season total: 3 mallards, 2 sprig, 10 teal, 10 widgeon, 3

spoonies, 2 buffleheads = 30.

Afterward: It happened again. Muriel and I took our customary post-season trip and wouldn't you know it, the ponds -- especially \#8 pond -- were full of ducks.

Of course, while in the process of recording these notes, I didn't realize that this would be my last Sprig Farm Journal. I hope you have enjoyed these notes and I wish all Sprig Farm alumni the very best in their new shooting venues.
